<h3>NOTE</h3>

<p>Mr. Thayer has undertaken to write, in detail and from the sources,
the history of Sterne’s vogue in Germany. As thus broadly defined the
task had not before been attempted, although phases of it had been
treated, more or less thoroughly, in recent monographs. The work here
submitted, the result of careful research in a number of American and
European libraries, is in my judgment an interesting and valuable
contribution to our knowledge of the literary relations of England and
Germany at the time of the great renascence of German letters.</p>

<h3>PREFACE</h3>


<p>The following study was begun in the autumn of 1901, and was
practically finished now more than a year ago. Since its completion two
works of interest to lovers of Sterne have been issued, Czerny’s study
of Sterne’s influence upon Hippel and Jean Paul, a&nbsp;work which the
present author had planned as a continuation of this book, and Prof.
Cross’s new definitive edition of Sterne.</p>

<p>I desire here to express my thanks to Prof. W.&nbsp;H. Carpenter,
Prof. Calvin Thomas and Prof. W.&nbsp;P. Trent, under whose guidance my
last year of University residence was spent: their interest in my work
was generous and unfailing; their admirable scholarship has been and
will continue to be an inspiration. I&nbsp;am indebted to Prof.
Carpenter and Prof. Thomas for many helpful suggestions regarding the
present work, and the latter especially has given freely of his valuable
time to a consideration of my problems. I&nbsp;am grateful also to
several other friends for helpful and kindly service, and to many
librarians in this country and in Europe for their courtesy.</p>

CHAPTER I</a><br>
&nbsp;<br>
INTRODUCTION</h3>


<p>The indebtedness of German culture to other peoples has been the
theme of much painstaking investigation. The history of German
literature is, in large measure, the story of its successive periods of
connection with the literatures of other lands, and hence scholars have
sought with industry and insight to bound and explain such literary
inter-relations.</p>

<p>The latter half of the eighteenth century was a period of predominant
English influence. The first half of the century had fostered this
ascendency through the popularity of the moral weeklies, the religious
epic, and the didactic poetry of Britain. Admiration for English ideals
was used as a weapon to combat French dominion in matters of taste, till
a kind of Anglomania spread, which was less absolute than the waning
Gallomania had been, only in such measure as the nature of the imitated
lay nearer the German spirit and hence allowed and cherished a parallel
independence rather than demanded utter subjection. Indeed, the study of
English masters may be said to have contributed more than any other
external cause to the golden age of German letters; to have worked with
untold beneficence in bringing faltering Germany to a consciousness of
her own inherent possibilities. This fact of foreign awakening of
national greatness through kinship of inborn racial characteristics
removes the seeming inconsistency that British influence was paramount
at the very time of Germany’s most individual, most national,
outburst.</p>

<p>The German literary world concerned itself zealously with each new
development across the channel. The German literary periodicals were
diligent and alert in giving their subscribers
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
<a name = "page2" id = "page2"> </a>
adequate intelligence concerning new books in England,<a class = "tag"
name = "tagI_1" id = "tagI_1" href = "#noteI_1">1</a> and various
journals<a class = "tag" name = "tagI_2" id = "tagI_2" href =
"#noteI_2">2</a> devoted exclusively to a retailing of English thought
for German readers are by their very existence eloquent testimony to the
supreme interest in things British. Through the medium of these literary
journals, intelligence concerning British literary interests was
disseminated, and the way was thus prepared for the reception of the
British authors themselves. Every English writer of eminence, every
English literary movement was in some way or other echoed in the
literature of the German fatherland. English authors were read in the
original, and in numerous and popular translations. A&nbsp;German
following is a well-nigh certain inference from an English success.
Sometimes the growth of German appreciation and imitation was immediate
and contemporaneous, or nearly so, with the English interest, as in the
case of the German enthusiasm for Bishop Percy’s “Reliques.” At other
times it tarried behind the period of interest in England, and was
gradual in its development. The suggestion that a book, especially a
novel, was translated from the English was an assurance of its receiving
consideration, and many original German novels were published under the
guise of English translations. Hermes roguishly avoids downright
falsehood, and yet avails himself of this popular trend by describing
his “Miss Fanny Wilkes” upon the title page as “So gut als aus dem
Englischen übersetzt,” and printing “so gut als” in very small type.
Müller in a letter<a class = "tag" name = "tagI_3" id = "tagI_3" href =
"#noteI_3">3</a> to Gleim, dated at Cassel, May 27, 1781, proposes to
alter names in Liscow’s works and to
<span class = "pagenum">3</span>
<a name = "page3" id = "page3"> </a>
publish his books as an English translation: “Germany would read him
with delight,” he says, and Gleim, in his reply, finds the idea
“splendid.” Out of this one reads clearly how the Germany of that time
was hanging on the lips of England.</p>

<p>As has been suggested, conscious or unconscious imitation in the home
literature is the unavoidable result of admiration for the foreign;
imitation of English masters is written large on this period of German
letters. Germany is especially indebted to the stirring impulse of the
English novel.</p>

<p>The intellectual development of a people is observable in its
successive periods of interest in different kinds of narration, in its
attitude toward the relation of fictitious events. The interest in the
extraordinary always precedes that in the ordinary; the <ins class =
"correction" title = "text unchanged">unstored</ins> mind finds pleasure
only in the unusual. An appreciation of the absorbing, vital interest of
everyday existence is the accomplishment of reflective training, and
betokens the spiritualized nature. Yet it must be observed in passing
that the crude interest of unschooled ignorance, and undeveloped taste
in the grotesque, the monstrous, the unreal, is not the same as the
intellectual man’s appreciation of the unreal in imagination and fancy.
The German novel had passed its time of service under the wild,
extraordinary and grotesque. The crudities of such tales of adventure
were softened and eliminated by the culturing influence of formal
classicism and by a newly won admiration for the everyday element in
life, contemporaneous with and dependent upon the gradual appreciation
of middle-class worth. At this point the English novel stepped in as a
guide, and the gradual shaping of the German novel in the direction of
an art-form is due primarily to the prevailing admiration of English
models.</p>

<p>The novel has never been a characteristic method of German
self-expression, while if any form of literary endeavor can be
designated as characteristically English, the novel may claim this
distinction; that is, more particularly the novel as distinguished from
the romance. “Robinson Crusoe” (1719) united the elements of the
extraordinary and the everyday, being the practical, unromantic account
of a remarkable situation; and its extensive vogue in Germany, the
myriad confessed imitations,
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
<a name = "page4" id = "page4"> </a>
may be said to form a kind of transition of interests. In it the
commonplace gains interest through the extraordinary situation. Such an
awakening assures a certain measure of interest remaining over for the
detailed relation of the everyday activities of life, when removed from
the exceptional situation. Upon this vantage ground the novel of
everyday life was built. Near the mid-century comes another mighty
influence from England, Richardson, who brings into the narration of
middle-class, everyday existence, the intense analysis of human
sensibilities. Richardson taught Germany to remodel her theories of
heroism, her whole system of admirations, her conception of deserts.
Rousseau’s voice from France spoke out a stirring appeal for the
recognition of human feelings. Fielding, though attacking Richardson’s
exaggeration of manner, and opposing him in his excess of emotionalism,
yet added a forceful influence still in favor of the real, present and
ordinary, as exemplified in the lives of vigorous human beings.</p>

<p>England’s leadership in narrative fiction, the superiority of the
English novel, especially the humorous novel, which was tacitly
acknowledged by these successive periods of imitation, when not actually
declared by the acclaim of the critic and the preference of the reading
public, has been attributed quite generally to the freedom of life in
England and the comparative thraldom in Germany. Gervinus<a class =
"tag" name = "tagI_4" id = "tagI_4" href = "#noteI_4">4</a> enlarges
upon this point, the possibility in Britain of individual development in
character and in action as compared with the constraint obtaining in
Germany, where originality, banished from life, was permissible only in
opinion. His ideas are substantially identical with those expressed many
years before in an article in the <i>Neue Bibliothek der schönen
Wissenschaften</i><a class = "tag" name = "tagI_5" id = "tagI_5" href =
"#noteI_5">5</a> entitled “Ueber die Laune.” Lichtenberg in his brief
essay, “Ueber den deutschen Roman,”<a class = "tag" name = "tagI_6" id =
"tagI_6" href = "#noteI_6">6</a> is undoubtedly more than half serious
in his arraignment of the German novel and his acknowledgment
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
<a name = "page5" id = "page5"> </a>
of the English novelist’s advantage: the trend of this satirical skit
coincides with the opinion above outlined, the points he makes being
characteristic of his own humorous bent. That the English sleep in
separate apartments, with big chimneys in their bedchambers, that they
have comfortable post-chaises with seats facing one another, where all
sorts of things may happen, and merry inns for the accommodation of the
traveler,&mdash;these features of British life are represented as
affording a grateful material to the novelist, compared with which
German life offers no corresponding opportunity. Humor, as a
characteristic element of the English novel, has been felt to be
peculiarly dependent upon the fashion of life in Britain. Blankenburg,
another eighteenth-century student of German literary conditions, in his
treatise on the novel<a class = "tag" name = "tagI_7" id = "tagI_7" href
= "#noteI_7">7</a>, has similar theories concerning the sterility of
German life as compared with English, especially in the production of
humorous characters<a class = "tag" name = "tagI_8" id = "tagI_8" href =
"#noteI_8">8</a>. He asserts theoretically that humor (Laune) should
never be employed in a novel of German life, because “Germany’s
political institutions and laws, and our nice Frenchified customs would
not permit this humor.” “On the one side,” he goes on to say, “is Gothic
formality; on the other, frivolity.” Later in the volume (p.&nbsp;191)
he confines the use of humorous characters to subordinate rôles;
otherwise, he says, the tendency to exaggeration would easily awaken
displeasure and disgust. Yet in a footnote, prompted by some misgiving
as to his theory, Blankenburg admits that much is possible to genius and
cites English novels where a humorous character appears with success in
the leading part; thus the theorist swerves about, and implies the lack
of German genius in this regard. Eberhard in his “Handbuch der
Aesthetik,”<a class = "tag" name = "tagI_9" id = "tagI_9" href =
"#noteI_9">9</a>
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
<a name = "page6" id = "page6"> </a>
in a rather unsatisfactory and confused study of humor, expresses
opinions agreeing with those cited above, and states that in England the
feeling of independence sanctions the surrender of the individual to
eccentric humor: hence England has produced more humorists than all the
rest of the world combined. There is, however, at least one voice raised
to explain in another way this deficiency of humor in German letters.
A&nbsp;critic in the <i>Bibliothek der schönen Wissenschaften</i><a
class = "tag" name = "tagI_10" id = "tagI_10" href = "#noteI_10">10</a>
attributes this lack not to want of original characters but to a lack of
men like Cervantes, Ben Jonson, Butler, Addison, Fielding.</p>

<p>There is undoubtedly some truth in both points of view, but the
defects of the eighteenth century German novel are due in larger measure
to the peculiar mental organization of German authorship than to lack of
interesting material in German life. The German novel was crushed under
the weight of pedantry and pedagogy. Hillebrand strikes the root of the
matter when he says,<a class = "tag" name = "tagI_11" id = "tagI_11"
href = "#noteI_11">11</a> “We are all schoolmasters, even Hippel could
not get away from the tutorial attitude.” The inborn necessity of German
culture is to impart information, to seek recruits for the maintenance
of some idea, to exploit some political, educational, or moral theory.
This irresistible impulse has left its trail over German fiction. The
men who wrote novels, as soon as they began to observe, began to
theorize, and the results of this speculation were inevitably embodied
in their works. They were men of mind rather than men of deeds, who
minimized the importance of action and exaggerated the reflective, the
abstract, the theoretical, the inner life of man. Hettner,<a class =
"tag" name = "tagI_12" id = "tagI_12" href = "#noteI_12">12</a> with
fine insight, points to the introduction to “Sebaldus Nothanker” as
exhibiting the characteristic of this epoch of fiction. Speculation was
the hero’s world, and in speculation lay for him the important things of
life; he knew not the real world, hence speculation concerning it was
his occupation. Consequential connection of events with character
<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
<a name = "page7" id = "page7"> </a>
makes the English novel the mirror of English life. Failure to achieve
such a union makes the German novel a mirror of speculative opinions
concerning life.</p>

<p>Hence we have Germany in the mid-eighteenth century prepared to
accept and adopt any literary dogma, especially when stamped with an
English popularity, which shall represent an interest rather in
extraordinary characters and unusual opinions than in astounding
adventure; which shall display a knowledge of human feeling and foster
the exuberant expression of&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Beside the devotees of any literary fashion are those who analyze
philosophically the causes, and forecast the probable results of such a
following. Thinking Germany became exercised over these facts of
successive intellectual and literary dependence, as indicative of
national limitations or foreboding disintegration. And thought was
accordingly directed to the study of the influence of imitation upon the
imitator, the effects of the imitative process upon national
characteristics, as well as the causes of imitation, the fundamental
occasion for national bondage in matters of life and letters. The part
played by Dr. Edward Young’s famous epistle to Richardson, “Conjectures
on Original Composition” (London, 1759), in this struggle for
originality is considerable. The essay was reprinted, translated and
made the theme of numerous treatises and discussions.<a class = "tag"
name = "tagI_13" id = "tagI_13" href = "#noteI_13">13</a> One needs only
to mention the concern of Herder, as displayed
<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
<a name = "page8" id = "page8"> </a>
in the “Fragmente über die neuere deutsche Litteratur,” and his
statement<a class = "tag" name = "tagI_14" id = "tagI_14" href =
"#noteI_14">14</a> with reference to the predicament as realized by
thoughtful minds may serve as a summing up of that part of the
situation. “Seit der Zeit ist keine Klage lauter and häufiger als über
den Mangel von Originalen, von Genies, von Erfindern, Beschwerden über
die Nachahmungs- und gedankenlose Schreibsucht der Deutschen.”</p>

<p>This thoughtful study of imitation itself was accompanied by more or
less pointed opposition to the heedless importation of foreign views,
and protests, sometimes vigorous and keen, sometimes flimsy and silly,
were entered against the slavish imitation of things foreign. Endeavor
was turned toward the establishment of independent ideals, and the
fostering of a taste for the characteristically national in literature,
as opposed to frank imitation and open borrowing.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagI_15" id = "tagI_15" href = "#noteI_15">15</a></p>

<p>The story of Laurence Sterne in Germany is an individual example of
sweeping popularity, servile admiration, extensive imitation and
concomitant opposition.</p>

This is well illustrated by the words prefaced to the revived and

to mention the more significant, because earlier, journals: <i>die

Seuffert’s Deutsche Litteraturdenkmale des 18. und 19. Jahrhunderts. The
literature of this study of imitation in the Germany of the second half
of the eighteenth century is considerable. The effort of much in the
Litteratur-Briefe may be mentioned as contributing to this line of
thought. The prize question of the Berlin Academy for 1788 brought forth
a book entitled: “Wie kann die Nachahmung sowohl alter als neuer fremden
Werke der schönen Wissenschaften <ins class = "correction" title =
"error for “den”?">des</ins> vaterländischen Geschmack entwickeln und
vervollkommnen?” by Joh. Chr. Schwabe, professor in Stuttgart. (Berlin,
pp. 120; reviewed in <i>Allg. Litt. Zeitung.</i> 1790. I, pp.
632&ndash;640.) Perhaps the first English essay upon German imitation of
British masters is that in the <i>Critical Journal</i>, Vol. III, which
was considered of sufficient moment for a German translation. See
<i>Morgenblatt</i>, I, Nr. 162, July 8, 1807. A&nbsp;writer in the
<i>Auserlesene Bibliothek der neusten deutschen Litteratur</i> (Lemgo,
1772&ndash;3), in an article entitled “Vom Zustande des Geschmacks beim
deutschen Publikum,” traces the tendency to imitate to the German
capacity for thinking rather than for feeling. (III, pp. 683&nbsp;ff.)
“Das deutsche Publikum,” he says, “scheint dazu bestimmt zu seyn,
nachzuahmen, nachzuurtheilen, nachzuempfinden.” Justus Möser condemns
his fellow countrymen soundly for their empty imitation. See fragment
published in “Sämmtliche Werke,” edited by B.&nbsp;R. Abeken. Berlin,
1858. IV, pp. 104&ndash;5.</p>

Herder’s sämmtliche Werke, edited by B.&nbsp;Suphan, Berlin, Weidman,
1877, I, 254. In the tenth fragment (second edition) he says the Germans
have imitated other nations, “so dass Nachahmer beinahe zum Beiwort und
zur zweiten Sylbe unseres Namens geworden.” See II, p.&nbsp;51. Many
years later Herder does not seem to view this period of imitation with
such regret as the attitude of these earlier criticisms would forecast.
In the “Ideen zur Geschichte und Kritik der Poesie und bildenden
Künste,” 1794&ndash;96, he states with a burst of enthusiasm over the
adaptability of the German language that he regards imitation as no just
reproach, for thereby has Germany become immeasurably the richer.</p>

The kind of praise bestowed on Hermes’s “Sophiens Reise” is a case in
point; it was greeted as the first real German novel, the traces of
English imitation being hardly noticeable. See <i>Magazin der deutschen
Critik</i>, Vol. I, St.&nbsp;2, pp. 245&ndash;<ins class = "correction"
title = ". for ,">251,</ins> 1772, signed “Kl.” Sattler’s “Friederike”
was accorded a similar welcome of German patriotism; see <i>Magazin der
deutschen Critik</i>, III, St.&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;233. The “Litterarische
Reise durch Deutschland” (Leipzig, 1786, p.&nbsp;82) calls “Sophiens
Reise” the first original German novel. See also the praise of Von
Thümmel’s “Wilhelmine” and “Sophiens Reise” in Blankenburg’s “Versuch
über den Roman,” pp. 237&ndash;9. Previously Germans had often hesitated
to lay the scenes of their novels in Germany, and in many others English
characters traveling or residing in Germany supply the un-German
element.</p>

CHAPTER II</a><br>
&nbsp;<br>
STERNE IN GERMANY BEFORE THE&nbsp;PUBLICATION<br>
OF THE SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY</h3>


<p>It is no exaggeration to assert that the works of Yorick obtained and
still retain a relatively more substantial position of serious
consideration and recognized merit in France and Germany than in the
countries where Sterne’s own tongue is spoken.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagII_1" id = "tagII_1" href = "#noteII_1">1</a> His place among the
English classics has, from the foreign point of view, never been a
dubious question, a&nbsp;matter of capricious taste and unstable ideals.
His peculiar message, whether interpreted and insisted upon with
clearness of insight, or blindness of misunderstanding, played its not
unimportant part in certain developments of continental literatures, and
his station in English literature, as viewed from a continental
standpoint, is naturally in part the reflex of the magnitude of his
influence in the literature of France and Germany, rather than an
estimate obtained exclusively from the actual worth of his own
accomplishment, and the nature of his own service as a leader and
innovator in English letters.</p>

<p>Sterne’s career in German literature, the esteem in which his own
works have been held, and the connection between the sentimental,
whimsical, contradictory English clergyman and his German imitators have
been noted, generally speaking, by all the historians of literature; and
several monographs and separate articles have been published on single
phases of the theme.<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_2" id = "tagII_2"
href = "#noteII_2">2</a> As yet, however, save for the investigations
which treat only of two or three authors, there has been hardly more
<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
<a name = "page10" id = "page10"> </a>
than the general statement of the facts, often inadequate, incomplete,
and sometimes inexact.</p>

<p>Sterne’s period of literary activity falls in the sixties, the very
heyday of British supremacy in Germany. The fame of Richardson was
hardly dimmed, though Musäus ridiculed his extravagances in “Grandison
der Zweite” (1760) at the beginning of the decade. In 1762&ndash;66
Wieland’s Shakespeare translation appeared, and his original works of
the period, “Agathon,” begun in 1761, and “Don Silvio von Rosalva,”
published in 1764, betray the influence of both Richardson and Fielding.
Ebert (1760&mdash;) revised and republished his translation of Young’s
“Night Thoughts,” which had attained popularity in the previous decade.
Goldsmith’s “Vicar of Wakefield” (1766) aroused admiration and
enthusiasm. To this time too belongs Ossian’s mighty voice. As early as
1762 the first bardic translations appeared, and Denis’s work came out
in 1768. Percy’s “Reliques,” published in England in 1765, were
extensively read and cited, a&nbsp;stimulating force to parallel German
activity. A&nbsp;selection from the “Reliques” appeared in Göttingen in
1767.</p>

<p>The outlook maintained in Germany for the worthy in British thought,
the translatable, the reproducible, was so vigilant and, in general, so
discerning that the introduction of Yorick into Germany was all but
inevitable. The nature of the literary relations then obtaining and
outlined above would forecast and almost necessitate such an adoption,
and his very failure to secure recognition would demand an
explanation.</p>

<p>Before the publication of Tristram Shandy it would be futile to seek
for any knowledge of Sterne on German soil. He had published, as is well
known, two sermons preached on occasions of note; and a satirical skit,
with kindly purpose, entitled “The History of a Good Warm Watchcoat,”
had been written, privately circulated, and then suppressed; yet he was
an unknown and comparatively insignificant English clergyman residing in
a provincial town, far, in those days very far, from those centers of
life which sent their enlightenment over the channel to the continent.
His fame was purely local. His sermons had, without doubt, rendered the
vicar of
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
<a name = "page11" id = "page11"> </a>
Sutton a rather conspicuous ecclesiastic throughout that region; his
eccentricities were presumably the talk of neighboring parishes; the
cathedral town itself probably tittered at his drolleries, and chattered
over his sentiments; his social graces undoubtedly found recognition
among county families and in provincial society, and his reputation as a
wit had probably spread in a vague, uncertain, transitory fashion beyond
the boundaries of the county. Yet the facts of local notoriety and
personal vogue are without real significance save in the light of later
developments; and we may well date his career in the world of books from
the year 1760, when the London world began to smile over the first
volumes of Tristram Shandy. From internal evidence in these early
volumes it is possible to note with some assurance the progress of their
composition and the approximate time of their completion. In his
wayward, fitful way, and possibly for his own amusement more than with
dreams of fame and fortune,<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_3" id =
"tagII_3" href = "#noteII_3">3</a> Sterne probably began the composition
of Shandy in January, 1759, and the completion of the first installment
is assigned to the summer or early autumn of that year. At the end of
the year<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_4" id = "tagII_4" href =
"#noteII_4">4</a> the first edition of the first two volumes was issued
in York, bearing the imprint of John Hinxham. Dodsley and Cooper
undertook the sale of the volumes in London, though the former had
declined to be responsible for the publication. They were ready for
delivery in the capital on the first day of the new year 1760. Sterne’s
fame was immediate; his personal triumph was complete and ranks with the
great successes in the history of our literature. On his arrival in
London in March, the world aristocratic, ecclesiastic, and literary was
eager to receive the new favorite, and his career of bewildering social
<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
<a name = "page12" id = "page12"> </a>
enjoyment, vigorous feasting and noteworthy privilege began. “No one”,
says Forster, “was so talked of in London this year and no one so
admired as the tall, thin, hectic-looking Yorkshire parson.”<a class =
"tag" name = "tagII_5" id = "tagII_5" href = "#noteII_5">5</a> From this
time on until his death Sterne was a most conspicuous personage in
English society, a&nbsp;striking, envied figure in English letters.</p>

<p>And yet it was some time before Germany learned of the new prodigy:
for reasons which will be treated later, the growth of the Sterne cult
in Germany was delayed, so that Yorick was in the plenitude of his
German fame when England had begun to look askance at him with critical,
fault-finding eye, or to accord him the more damning condemnation of
forgetfulness.</p>

<p>The first mention of Sterne’s name in Germany may well be the brief
word in the <i>Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent</i><a class =
"tag" name = "tagII_6" id = "tagII_6" href = "#noteII_6">6</a> for
January 19, 1762, in a letter from the regular London correspondent,
dated January 8. In a tone of particularity which would mark the
introduction of a new and strange personality into his communications,
the correspondent states the fact of Sterne’s departure for Paris in
pursuit of lost health. This journal may further be taken as an example
of those which devoted a remarkable amount of space to British affairs,
since it was published in the North German seaport town, where the
mercantile connection with Britain readily fostered the exchange of
other than purely commercial commodities. And yet in Hamburg Sterne
waited full two years for a scanty recognition even of his English
fame.</p>

<p>In the fourth year after the English publication of Shandy comes the
first attempt to transplant Sterne’s gallery of originals to German
shores. This effort, of rather dubious success, is the Zückert
translation of Tristram Shandy, a&nbsp;rendering weak and inaccurate,
but nevertheless an important first step in the German Shandy cult.
Johann Friedrich Zückert,<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_7" id =
"tagII_7" href = "#noteII_7">7</a> the translator, was born December 19,
1739, and died in Berlin
<span class = "pagenum">13</span>
<a name = "page13" id = "page13"> </a>
May 1, 1778. He studied medicine at the University of Frankfurt an der
Oder, became a physician in Berlin, but, because of bodily disabilities,
devoted himself rather to study and society than to the practice of his
profession. His publications are fairly numerous and deal principally
with medical topics, especially with the question of foods. In the year
after the appearance of his Shandy translation, Zückert published an
essay which indicates the direction of his tastes and gives a clue to
his interest in Tristram. It was entitled “Medizinische und Moralische
Abhandlung von den Leidenschaften,”<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_8" id
= "tagII_8" href = "#noteII_8">8</a> and discloses a tendency on the
part of the author to an analysis of the passions and moods of man, an
interest in the manner of their generation, and the method of their
working. This treatise was quite probably written, or conceived, while
its author was busied with Shandy, and his division of the temperaments
(p.&nbsp;53) into the sanguine or warm moist, the choleric or warm dry,
the phlegmatic or cold moist, and the melancholy or cold dry, is not
unlike some of Walter Shandy’s half-serious, half-jesting scientific
theories, though, to be sure, it falls in with much of the inadequate
and ill-applied terminology of the time.</p>

<p>Zückert’s translation of the first six parts<a class = "tag" name =
"tagII_9" id = "tagII_9" href = "#noteII_9">9</a> of Tristram Shandy
appeared in 1763, and bore the imprint of the publisher Lange, Berlin
und Stralsund. The title read “Das Leben und die Meynungen des Herrn
Tristram Shandy,” the first of the long series of “Leben und Meynungen”
which flooded the literature of the succeeding decades, this becoming a
conventional title for a novel. It is noteworthy that until the
publication of parts VII and VIII in 1765, there is no mention of the
real author’s name. To these later volumes the translator prefaces a
statement which contains some significant intelligence concerning his
aim and his interpretation of Sterne’s underlying purpose. He says he
would never have ventured on the translation of so ticklish a book if he
had foreseen the difficulties; that he believed such a translation would
be a real service to the German public, and that he never fancied the
critics could hold him to the very letter, as in the
<span class = "pagenum">14</span>
<a name = "page14" id = "page14"> </a>
rendering of a classic author. He confesses to some errors and promises
corrections in a possible new edition. He begs the public to judge the
translation in accord with its purpose “to delight and enliven the
public and to acquaint the Germans with a really wonderful genius.” To
substantiate his statement relative to the obstacles in his way, he
outlines in a few words Sterne’s peculiar, perplexing style, as regards
both use of language and the arrangement of material. He conceives
Sterne’s purpose as a desire to expose to ridicule the follies of his
countrymen and to incorporate serious truths into the heart of his
jesting.</p>

<p>Since the bibliographical facts regarding the subsequent career of
this Zückert translation have been variously mangled and misstated, it
may be well, though it depart somewhat from the regular chronological
order of the narrative, to place this information here in connection
with the statement of its first appearance. The translation, as
published in 1763, contained only the first six parts of Sterne’s work.
In 1765 the seventh and eighth parts were added, and in 1767 a ninth
appeared, but the latter was a translation of a spurious English
original.<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_10" id = "tagII_10" href =
"#noteII_10">10</a> In 1769, the shrewd publisher began to issue a new
and slightly altered edition of the translation, which bore, however, on
the title page “nach einer neuen Uebersetzung” and the imprint, Berlin
und Stralsund bey Gottlieb August Langen, Parts I and II being dated
1769; Parts III and IV, 1770; Parts V, VI, VII and VIII, 1771; Part IX,
1772. Volumes III-VIII omit Stralsund as a joint place of publication.
In 1773, when it became noised abroad that Bode, the <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘sucessful’">successful</ins> and
honored translator of the Sentimental Journey, was at work upon a German
rendering of Shandy, Lange once more forced his wares upon the market,
this time publishing the Zückert translation with the use of Wieland’s
then influential name on the title page, “Auf Anrathen des Hrn. Hofraths
Wielands verfasst.”
<span class = "pagenum">15</span>
<a name = "page15" id = "page15"> </a>
Wieland was indignant at this misuse of his name and repudiated all
connection with this “new translation.” This edition was probably
published late in 1773, as Wieland in his review in the <i>Merkur</i>
gives it that date, but the volumes themselves bear the date of 1774.<a
class = "tag" name = "tagII_11" id = "tagII_11" href =
"#noteII_11">11</a> We learn from the <i>Merkur</i> (VI. 363) that
Zückert was not responsible for the use of Wieland’s name.</p>

<p>These are the facts of the case. Meusel in his account of Zückert
gives the date of the first edition as 1774, and the second edition is
registered but the date is left blank. Jördens, probably depending on
the information given by the review in the <i>Merkur</i>, to which
reference is made, assigns 1773 as the date. This edition, as is shown
above, is really the third.</p>

<p>This Zückert translation is first reviewed by the above mentioned
<i>Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent</i> in the issue for
January 4, 1764. The review, however, was not calculated to lure the
German reader of the periodical to a perusal either of the original, or
of the rendering in question: it is concerned almost exclusively with a
summary of the glaring inaccuracies in the first nineteen pages of the
work and with correct translations of the same; and it is in no sense of
the word an appreciation of the book. The critic had read Shandy in the
original, and had believed that no German hack translator<a class =
"tag" name = "tagII_12" id = "tagII_12" href = "#noteII_12">12</a> would
venture a version in the language of the fatherland. It is a review
which shows only the learning of the reviewer, displays the weakness of
the translator, but gives no idea of the nature of the book itself, not
even a glimpse of the critic’s own estimate of the book, save the
implication that he himself had understood the original, though many
Englishmen even were staggered by its obtuseness and failed to
comprehend the subtlety of its allusion. It is criticism in the
narrowest, most arrogant sense of the word, destructive instead of
informing, blinding instead of illuminating. It is noteworthy that
Sterne’s name is nowhere mentioned in the review, nor is there a hint of
Tristram’s English popularity. The author of this
<span class = "pagenum">16</span>
<a name = "page16" id = "page16"> </a>
unsigned criticism is not to be located with certainty, yet it may well
have been Bode, the later apostle of Sterne-worship in Germany. Bode was
a resident of Hamburg at this time, was exceptionally proficient in
English and, according to Jördens<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_13" id =
"tagII_13" href = "#noteII_13">13</a> and Schröder,<a class = "tag" name
= "tagII_14" id = "tagII_14" href = "#noteII_14">14</a> he was in
1762&ndash;3 the editor of the <i>Hamburgischer unpartheyischer
Correspondent</i>. The precise date when Bode severed his connection
with the paper is indeterminate, yet this, the second number of the new
year 1764, may have come under his supervision even if his official
connection ended exactly with the close of the old year. To be sure,
when Bode ten years later published his own version of Shandy, he
translated, with the exception of two rather insignificant cases, none
of the passages verbally the same as the reviewer in this journal, but
it would be unreasonable to attach any great weight to this fact. Eight
or nine years later, when undertaking the monumental task of rendering
the whole of Shandy into German, it is not likely that Bode would recall
the old translations he had made in this review or concern himself about
them. A&nbsp;brief comparison of the two sets of translations suggests
that the critic was striving merely for accuracy in correcting the
errors of Zückert, and that Bode in his formal translation shows a riper
and more certain feeling for the choice of words; the effect of
purposeful reflection is unmistakable. Of course this in no way proves
Bode to have been the reviewer, but the indications at least allow the
probability.</p>

<p>As was promised in the preface to Parts VII and VIII, to which
reference has already been made, the new edition was regarded as an
opportunity for correction of errors, but this bettering is accomplished
with such manifest carelessness and ignorance as to suggest a further
possibility, that the publisher, Lange, eager to avail himself of the
enthusiasm for Sterne, which burst out on the publication of the
Sentimental Journey, thrust this old translation on the public without
providing for thorough revision, or complete correction of flagrant
errors. The following quotations will suffice to demonstrate the
inadequacy of the revision:</p>

</table>

<p>This last astounding translation is retained in the second edition in
spite of the reviewers’ ridicule, but the most nonsensical of all the
renderings, whereby “the momentum of the coach horse was so great”
becomes “der Augenblick des Kutschpferdes war so gross” is fortunately
corrected.<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_15" id = "tagII_15" href =
"#noteII_15">15</a></p>

<p>These examples of slipshod alteration or careless retention contrast
quite unfavorably with the attitude of the translator in the preface to
parts VII and VIII, in which he confesses to the creeping in of errors
in consequence of the perplexities of the rendering, and begs for
“reminders and explanations” of this and that passage, thereby
displaying an eagerness to accept hints for emendation. This is
especially remarkable when it is noted that he has in the second edition
not even availed himself of the corrections given in the
<i>Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent</i>, and has allowed some
of the most extraordinary blunders to stand. These facts certainly favor
the theory that Zückert himself had little or nothing to do with the
second edition and its imperfect revision. This supposition finds
further evidence in the fact that the ninth part of Shandy, as issued by
Lange in the second (1772) and third (1774) editions, was still a
translation of the spurious English volume, although the fraud was well
known and the genuine
<span class = "pagenum">18</span>
<a name = "page18" id = "page18"> </a>
volume was read and appreciated. Of this genuine last part Dr. Zückert
never made a translation. It may be remarked in passing that a
translation bristling with such errors, blunders which at times degrade
the text into utter nonsense, could hardly be an efficient one in
spreading appreciation of Shandy.</p>

<p>A little more than a year after the review in the <i>Hamburgischer
unpartheyischer Correspondent</i>, which has been cited, the
<i>Jenaische Zeitungen von gelehrten Sachen</i> in the number dated
March 1, 1765, treats Sterne’s masterpiece in its German disguise. This
is the first mention of Sterne’s book in the distinctively literary
journals. The tone of this review is further that of an introducer of
the new, and the critique is manifestly inserted in the paper as an
account of a new book. The reviewer is evidently unaware of the author’s
name, since the words which accompany the title, from the English, are
nowhere elucidated, and no hint of authorship, or popularity in England,
or possible far-reaching appeal in Germany is traceable. The idea of the
hobby-horse is new to the reviewer and his explanation of it implies
that he presumed Sterne’s use of the term would be equally novel to the
readers of the periodical. His compliment to the translation indicates
further that he was unacquainted with the review in the <i>Hamburgischer
unpartheyischer Correspondent</i>.</p>

<p>A little more than a year later, June 13, 1766, this same journal,
under the caption “London,” reviews the Becket and de Hondt four-volume
edition of the “Sermons of Mr. Yorick.” The critic thinks a warning
necessary: “One should not be deceived by the title: the author’s name
is not Yorick,” and then he adds the information of the real authorship.
This is a valid indication that, in the opinion of the reviewer, the
name Yorick would not be sufficiently linked in the reader’s mind with
the personality of Sterne and the fame of his first great book, to
preclude the possibility, or rather probability, of error. This state of
affairs is hardly reconcilable with any widespread knowledge of the
first volumes of Shandy. The criticism of the sermons which follows
implies, on the reviewer’s part, an acquaintance with Sterne, with
Tristram, a&nbsp;“whimsical and roguish novel which would in our land
<span class = "pagenum">19</span>
<a name = "page19" id = "page19"> </a>
be but little credit to a clergyman,” and with the hobby-horse idea. The
spirit of the review is, however, quite possibly prompted, and this
added information supplied, by the London correspondent, and retold only
with a savor of familiarity by this critic; for at the end of this
communication this London correspondent is credited with the suggestion
that quite probably the sermons were never actually preached.</p>

<p>The first mention of Sterne in the <i>Göttingische Gelehrte
Anzeigen</i> is in the number for November 15, 1764. In the report from
London is a review<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_16" id = "tagII_16"
href = "#noteII_16">16</a> of the fifth edition of Yorick’s Sermons,
published by Dodsley in two volumes, 1764. To judge by the tenor of his
brief appreciation, the reviewer does not anticipate any knowledge of
Sterne whatsoever or of Shandy among the readers of the periodical. He
states that the sermons had aroused much interest in England because of
their authorship “by Lorenz Sterne, author of Tristram Shandy,
a&nbsp;book in which a remarkable humor is exhibited.” He mentions also
that the sermon on the conscience had already been published in the
novel, but is ignorant of its former and first appearance. Three years
later, July 20, 1767,<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_17" id = "tagII_17"
href = "#noteII_17">17</a> the same periodical devotes a long critical
review to the four-volume London edition of the sermons. The publisher’s
name is not given, but it is the issue of Becket and de Hondt. The
restating of elementary information concerning authorship is indicative
of the tardy progress made by Yorick in these years in gaining
recognition in Germany. The reviewer thinks it even necessary to add
that Yorick is the name of the clergyman who plays a waggish
(possierliche) rôle in Shandy, and that Sterne cherished the opinion
that this designation on the title-page would be better known than his
own name.</p>

<p>In the meantime Swiss piety and Swiss devotion to things English had
been instrumental in bringing out a translation of Sterne’s sermons,<a
class = "tag" name = "tagII_18" id = "tagII_18" href =
"#noteII_18">18</a> the first volume of which appeared in 1766.
<span class = "pagenum">20</span>
<a name = "page20" id = "page20"> </a>
The Swiss translation was occasioned by its author’s expectation of
interest in the sermons as sermons; this is in striking contrast to the
motives which led to their original publication in England. The brief
preface of the translator gives no information of Sterne, or of Shandy;
the translator states his reasons for the rendering, his own interest in
the discourses, his belief that such sermons would not be superfluous in
Germany, and his opinion that they were written for an increasing class
of readers, “who, though possessed of taste and culture and laying claim
to probity, yet for various reasons stand apart from moral instruction
and religious observance.” He also changed the original order of the
sermons. The first part of this Swiss translation is reviewed in the
<i>Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek</i> in the first number of 1768, and
hence before the Sentimental Journey had seen the light even in London.
The review is characterized by unstinted praise: Sterne is congratulated
upon his deviation from the conventional in homiletical discourse, is
commended as an excellent painter of moral character and situations,
though he abstains from the use of the common engines of eloquence. His
narrative powers are also noted with approval and his ability to retain
the attention of his hearers through clever choice of emphasized detail
is mentioned with appreciation. Yet in all this no reference is made to
Sterne’s position in English letters, a&nbsp;fact which could hardly
have failed of comment, if the reviewer had been aware of it, especially
in view of the relation of Sterne’s popularity to the very existence of
this published volume of sermons, or if it had been expected that the
fact of authorship would awaken interest in any considerable number of
readers. The tone of the review is further hardly reconcilable with a
knowledge of Sterne’s idiosyncrasies as displayed in Shandy.
A&nbsp;brief consideration of the principles of book-reviewing would
establish the fact indisputably that the mentioning of a former book,
some hint of familiarity with the author by open or covert allusion, is
an integral and inevitable part of the review of a later book. This
review is the only mention of Sterne in this
<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
<a name = "page21" id = "page21"> </a>
magazine<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_19" id = "tagII_19" href =
"#noteII_19">19</a> before the publication of the Sentimental Journey.
A&nbsp;comparison of this recension, narrow in outlook, bound, as it is,
to the very book under consideration, with those of the second and third
volumes of the sermons in the same magazine during the year 1770,<a
class = "tag" name = "tagII_20" id = "tagII_20" href =
"#noteII_20">20</a> is an illuminating illustration of the sweeping
change brought in by the Journey. In the latter critique we find
appreciation of Yorick’s characteristics, enthusiastic acceptation of
his sentiment, fond and familiar allusions to both Shandy and the
Sentimental Journey. In the brief space of two years Sterne’s
sentimentalism had come into its own.</p>

<p>The <i>Bremisches Magazin</i>,<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_21" id =
"tagII_21" href = "#noteII_21">21</a> which was employed largely in
publishing translations from English periodicals, and contained in each
number lists, generally much belated, of new English books, noted in the
third number for 1762, among the new books from April to December, 1760,
Mr. Yorick’s Sermons, published by Mr. Sterne, and then, as customary in
these catalogues, translated the title into “Herrn Yorick’s Predigten
ans Licht gestellt von Hn. Sterne.” Four years later, in the first
volume of the <i>Neues Bremisches Magazin</i>,<a class = "tag" name =
"tagII_22" id = "tagII_22" href = "#noteII_22">22</a> announcement is
made of the third and fourth volumes of Yorick’s Sermons. During this
period sufficient intelligence concerning Sterne is current to warrant
the additional statement that “This Mr. Sterne, the author of the
strange book, Tristram Shandy, is the author himself.” The notice closes
with the naïve but astounding information, “He took the name Yorick
because he is a preacher in York; furthermore, these sermons are much
praised.” No further proof is needed that this reviewer was guiltless of
any knowledge of Shandy beyond the title. The ninth volume of Shandy is
announced in the same number among the new English books.</p>

<p>In 1767, the year before the publication of the Sentimental Journey,
we find three notices of Tristram Shandy. In the <i>Deutsche Bibliothek
der schönen Wissenschaften</i><a class = "tag" name = "tagII_23" id =
"tagII_23" href = "#noteII_23">23</a> is a very
<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
<a name = "page22" id = "page22"> </a>
brief but, in the main, commendatory review of the Zückert translation,
coupled with the statement that the last parts are not by Sterne, but
with the claim that the humor of the original is fairly well maintained.
The review is signed “Dtsh.” Another Halle periodical, the <i>Hallische
Neue Gelehrte Zeitungen</i>, in the issue for August 10, 1767<a class =
"tag" name = "tagII_24" id = "tagII_24" href = "#noteII_24">24</a>
reviews the same volumes with a much more decided acknowledgment of
merit. It is claimed that the difference is not noticeable, and that the
ninth part is almost more droll than all the others, an opinion which is
noteworthy testimony to its originator’s utter lack of comprehension of
the whole work and of the inanity of this spurious last volume. The
statement by both of these papers that the last three volumes,<a class =
"tag" name = "tagII_25" id = "tagII_25" href = "#noteII_25">25</a> parts
VII, VIII and IX, of the Zückert translation, rest on spurious English
originals, is, of course, false as far as VII and VIII are concerned,
and is true only of&nbsp;IX.</p>

<p>In the <i>Neue Bibliothek der schönen Wissenschaften</i>, the last
number for 1766<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_26" id = "tagII_26" href =
"#noteII_26">26</a> contains the first mention of Sterne’s name in this
representative literary periodical. It is an article entitled “Ueber die
Laune,”<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_27" id = "tagII_27" href =
"#noteII_27">27</a> which is concerned with the phenomena of
hypochrondia and melancholia, considered as illnesses, and their
possible cure. The author claims to have found a remedy in the books
which do not depress the spirits with exhibition of human woes, but
which make merry over life’s follies. In this he claims merely to be
following the advice of St. Evremond to the Count of Olonne. His method
he further explains by tracing humor to its beginnings in Aristophanes
and by following its development through Latin, new Latin (Erasmus,
Thomas Morus, etc.), French and English writers. Among the latter Sterne
is named. Unfortunately for the present purpose, the author is led by
caution and fear of giving the offense of omission to refrain from
naming the German writers who might be classed with the cited
representatives of humor. In closing, he recommends heartily to
<span class = "pagenum">23</span>
<a name = "page23" id = "page23"> </a>
those teased with melancholy a “portion of leaves of Lucian, some
half-ounces of ‘Don Quixote’ or some drachms of ‘Tom Jones’ or ‘Tristram
Shandy.’” Under the heading, “New English Books,” in the third number of
the same periodical for 1767, is a brief but significant notice of the
ninth volume of Tristram Shandy.<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_28" id =
"tagII_28" href = "#noteII_28">28</a> “The ninth part of the well-known
‘Life of Tristram Shandy’ has been published; we would not mention it,
if we did not desire on this occasion to note at least once in our
magazine a book which is incontestably the strangest production of wit
and humor which has ever been brought forth. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The author
of this original book is a clergyman by the name of Sterne, who, under
his Harlequin’s name, Yorick, has given to the world the most excellent
sermons.” The review contains also a brief word of comparison with
Rabelais and a quotation from an English critic expressing regret at
Yorick’s embroidering “the choicest flowers of genius on a paultry
groundwork of buffoonry.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_29" id =
"tagII_29" href = "#noteII_29">29</a> This late mention of Sterne’s
great novel, and the manner in which it is made are not without their
suggestions as to the attitude even of the German literary world toward
Yorick. The notice is written in a tone of forced condescension. The
writer is evidently compelled, as representative of British literary
interests, to bear witness to the Shandy craze, but the attitude of the
review is plainly indicative of its author’s disbelief in any occasion
for especial concern about Yorick in Germany. Sterne himself is
mentioned as a fitful whim of British taste, and a German devotion to
him is beyond the flight of fancy.<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_30" id
= "tagII_30" href = "#noteII_30">30</a></p>

<p>Individual authors, aware of international literary conditions, the
inner circle of German culture, became acquainted
<span class = "pagenum">24</span>
<a name = "page24" id = "page24"> </a>
with Tristram Shandy during this period before the publication of the
Sentimental Journey and learned to esteem the eccentric parson. Bode’s
possible acquaintance with the English original previous to 1764 has
been already noted. Lessing’s admiration for Sterne naturally is
associated with his two statements of remarkable devotion to Yorick,
both of which, however, date from a period when he had already become
acquainted with the Journey. At precisely what time Lessing first read
Tristram Shandy it is impossible to determine with accuracy. Moses
Mendelssohn writes to him in the summer of 1763:<a class = "tag" name =
"tagII_31" id = "tagII_31" href = "#noteII_31">31</a> “Tristram Shandy
is a work of masterly originality. At present, to be sure, I&nbsp;have
read only the first two volumes. In the beginning the book vexed me
exceedingly. I&nbsp;rambled on from digression to digression without
grasping the real humor of the author. I&nbsp;regarded him as a man like
our Liscow, whom, as you know, I&nbsp;don’t particularly fancy; and yet
the book pleases Lessing!” This is sufficient proof that Mendelssohn
first read Shandy early in 1763, but, though not improbable, it is yet
rather hazardous to conclude that Lessing also had read the book shortly
before, and had just recommended it to his friend. The literary
friendship existing between them, and the general nature of their
literary relations and communications, would rather favor such a
hypothesis. The passage is, however, a&nbsp;significant confession of
partial failure on the part of the clever and erudite Mendelssohn to
appreciate Sterne’s humor. It has been generally accepted that Lessing’s
dramatic fragment, “Die Witzlinge,” included two characters modeled
confessedly after Yorick’s familiar personages, Trim and Eugenius.
Boxberger and others have stamped such a theory with their authority.<a
class = "tag" name = "tagII_32" id = "tagII_32" href =
"#noteII_32">32</a> If this were true, “Die Witzlinge” would undoubtedly
be the first example
<span class = "pagenum">25</span>
<a name = "page25" id = "page25"> </a>
of Sterne’s influence working directly upon the literary activity of a
German author. The fragment has, however, nothing to do with Tristram
Shandy, and a curious error has here crept in through the remarkable
juxtaposition of names later associated with Sterne. The plan is really
derived directly from Shadwell’s “Bury Fair” with its “Mr. Trim”
fancifully styled “Eugenius.” Those who tried to establish the
connection could hardly have been familiar with Tristram Shandy, for
Lessing’s Trim as outlined in the sketch has nothing in common with the
Corporal.</p>

<p>Erich Schmidt, building on a suggestion of Lichtenstein, found a
“Dosis Yorikscher Empfindsamkeit”<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_33" id =
"tagII_33" href = "#noteII_33">33</a> in Tellheim, and connected the
episode of the Chevalier de St. Louis with the passage in “Minna von
Barnhelm” (II,&nbsp;2) in which Minna contends with the innkeeper that
the king cannot know all deserving men nor reward them. Such an identity
of sentiment must be a pure coincidence for “Minna von Barnhelm” was
published at Easter, 1767, nearly a year before the Sentimental Journey
appeared.</p>

<p>A connection between Corporal Trim and Just has been suggested,<a
class = "tag" name = "tagII_34" id = "tagII_34" href =
"#noteII_34">34</a> but no one has by investigation established such a
kinship. Both servants are patterns of old-fashioned fidelity, types of
unquestioning service on the part of the inferior, a&nbsp;relation which
existed between Orlando and Adam in “As You Like It,” and which the
former describes:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“O good old man, how well in thee appears</p>
<p>The constant service of the antique world,</p>
<p>When service sweat for duty, not for meed;</p>
<p>Thou art not for the fashion of these times.”</p>
</div>

<p>Tellheim recognizes the value of Just’s service, and honors his
subordinate for his unusual faithfulness; yet there exists here no such
cordial comradeship as marked the relation between Sterne’s originals.
But one may discern the occasion of this in the character of Tellheim,
who has no resemblance to Uncle Toby, rather than in any dissimilarity
between the characters of the servants. The use of the relation between
master and
<span class = "pagenum">26</span>
<a name = "page26" id = "page26"> </a>
man as a subject for literary treatment was probably first brought into
fashion by Don Quixote, and it is well-nigh certain that Sterne took his
cue from Cervantes.</p>

<p>According to Erich Schmidt, the episode of Just’s dog, as the servant
relates it in the 8th scene of the 1st act, could have adorned the
Sentimental Journey, but the similarity of motif here in the treatment
of animal fidelity is pure coincidence. Certainly the method of using
the episode is not reminiscent of any similar scene in Sterne. Just’s
dog is not introduced for its own sake, nor like the ass at Nampont to
afford opportunity for exciting humanitarian impulses, and for throwing
human character into relief by confronting it with sentimental
possibilities, but for the sake of a forceful, telling and immediate
comparison. Lessing was too original a mind, and at the time when
“Minna” was written, too complete and mature an artist to follow another
slavishly or obviously, except avowedly under certain conditions and
with particular purpose. He himself is said to have remarked, “That must
be a pitiful author who does not borrow something once in a while,”<a
class = "tag" name = "tagII_35" id = "tagII_35" href =
"#noteII_35">35</a> and it does not seem improbable that the figure of
Trim was hovering in his memory while he was creating his Just.
Especially does this seem plausible when we remember that Lessing wrote
his drama during the years when Shandy was appearing, when he must have
been occupied with it, and at the first flush of his admiration.</p>

<p>This supposition, however undemonstrable, is given some support by
our knowledge of a minor work of Lessing, which has been lost. On
December 28, 1769, Lessing writes to Ebert from Hamburg: “Alberti is
well; and what pleases me about him, as much as his health, is that the
news of his reconciliation with Goeze was a false report. So Yorick will
probably preach and send his sermon soon.”<a class = "tag" name =
"tagII_36" id = "tagII_36" href = "#noteII_36">36</a> And Ebert replies
in a letter dated at Braunschweig, January 7, 1770, expressing a desire
that Lessing should fulfil his promise, and cause Yorick to preach not
once but many times.<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_37" id = "tagII_37"
href = "#noteII_37">37</a> The circumstance herein
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
<a name = "page27" id = "page27"> </a>
involved was first explained by Friedrich Nicolai in an article in the
<i>Berlinische Monatsschrift</i>, 1791.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagII_38" id = "tagII_38" href = "#noteII_38">38</a> As a trick upon
his friend Alberti, who was then in controversy with Goeze, Lessing
wrote a sermon in Yorick’s manner; the title and part of the
introduction to it were privately printed by Bode and passed about among
the circle of friends, as if the whole were in press. We are entirely
dependent on Nicolai’s memory for our information relative to this sole
endeavor on Lessing’s part to adopt completely the manner of Sterne.
Nicolai asserts that this effort was a complete success in the
realization of Yorick’s simplicity, his good-natured but acute
philosophy, his kindly sympathy and tolerance, even his merry
whimsicality.</p>

<p>This introduction, which Nicolai claims to have recalled essentially
as Lessing wrote it, relates the occasion of Yorick’s writing the
sermon. Uncle Toby and Trim meet a cripple in a ragged French uniform;
Capt. Shandy gives the unfortunate man several shillings, and Trim draws
out a penny and in giving it says, “French Dog!” The narrative
continues:</p>

<p>“The Captain<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_39" id = "tagII_39" href =
"#noteII_39">39</a> was silent for some seconds and then said, turning
to Trim, ‘It is a man, Trim, and not a dog!’ The French veteran had
hobbled after them: at the Captain’s words Trim gave him another penny,
saying again ‘French Dog!’ ‘And, Trim, the man is a soldier.’ Trim
stared him in the face, gave him a penny again and said, ‘French Dog!’
‘And, Trim, he is a brave soldier; you see he has fought for his
fatherland and has been sorely wounded.’ Trim pressed his hand, while he
gave him another penny, and said ‘French Dog!’ ‘And, Trim, this soldier
is a good but unfortunate husband, and has a wife and four little
children.’ Trim, with a tear in his eye, gave all he had left and said,
rather softly, ‘French Dog!’”</p>

<p>This scene recalls vividly the encounter between Just and the
landlord in the first act of “Minna,” the passage in which Just
continues to assert that the landlord is a “Grobian.” There are the same
tactics, the same persistence, the same contrasts. The passage quoted
was, of course, written after
<span class = "pagenum">28</span>
<a name = "page28" id = "page28"> </a>
“Minna,” but from it we gather evidence that Corporal Trim and his own
Just were similar creations, that to him Corporal Trim, when he had
occasion to picture him, must needs hark back to the figure of Just,
a&nbsp;character which may well originally have been suggested by Capt.
Shandy’s faithful servant.</p>

<p>Among German literati, Herder is another representative of
acquaintance with Sterne and appreciation of his masterpiece. Haym<a
class = "tag" name = "tagII_40" id = "tagII_40" href =
"#noteII_40">40</a> implies that Sterne and Swift are mentioned more
often than any other foreign authors in Herder’s writings of the Riga
period (November, 1764, to May, 1769). This would, of course, include
the first fervor of enthusiasm concerning the Sentimental Journey, and
would be a statement decidedly doubtful, if applied exclusively to the
previous years. In a note-book, possibly reaching back before his
arrival in Riga to his student days in Königsberg, Herder made
quotations from Shandy and Don Quixote, possibly preparatory notes for
his study of the ridiculous in the Fourth Wäldchen.<a class = "tag" name
= "tagII_41" id = "tagII_41" href = "#noteII_41">41</a> In May, 1766,
Herder went to Mitau to visit Hamann, and he designates the account of
the events since leaving there as “ein Capitel meines Shandyschen
Romans”<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_42" id = "tagII_42" href =
"#noteII_42">42</a> and sends it as such to <ins class = "correction"
title = "“ missing">“my</ins> uncle, Tobias Shandy.” Later a letter,
written 27&ndash;16, August, 1766, is begun with the heading, “Herder to
Hamann and no more Yorick to Tobias Shandy,” in which he says:
“I&nbsp;am now in a condition where I can play the part of Yorick as
little as Panza that of Governor.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_43" id
= "tagII_43" href = "#noteII_43">43</a> The same letter contains another
reference and the following familiar allusion to Sterne: “Grüsen Sie
Trim, wenn ich gegen keinen den beleidigenden Karakter Yoriks oder
leider! das Schicksal wider Willen zu beleidigen, habe, so ist’s doch
gegen ihn und Hartknoch.” These last quotations are significant as
giving proof that Shandy had so far forced its claims upon a little set
of book-lovers in the remote east, Herder, Hamann and a few others, that
they gave one another in play names from the English novel.
A&nbsp;letter from Hamann to Herder, dated Königsberg,
<span class = "pagenum">29</span>
<a name = "page29" id = "page29"> </a>
June 10, 1767, indicates that the former shared also the devotion to
Sterne.<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_44" id = "tagII_44" href =
"#noteII_44">44</a></p>

<p>In the first collection of “Fragmente über die neuere deutsche
Litteratur,” 1767, the sixth section treats of the “Idiotismen” of a
language. British “Laune” is cited as such an untranslatable “Idiotism”
and the lack of German humorists is noted, and Swift is noted
particularly as an English example. In the second and revised edition
Herder adds material containing allusion to Hudibras and Tristram.<a
class = "tag" name = "tagII_45" id = "tagII_45" href =
"#noteII_45">45</a> The first and second “Kritische Wäldchen” contain
several references to Sterne and Shandy.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagII_46" id = "tagII_46" href = "#noteII_46">46</a> Herder, curiously
enough, did not read the Sentimental Journey until the autumn of 1768,
as is disclosed in a letter to Hamann written in November,<a class =
"tag" name = "tagII_47" id = "tagII_47" href = "#noteII_47">47</a> which
also shows his appreciation of Sterne. “An Sterne’s Laune,” he says,
“kann ich mich nicht satt lesen. Eben den Augenblick, da ich an ihn
denke, bekomme ich seine Sentimental Journey zum Durchlesen, und wenn
nicht meine Englische Sprachwissenschaft scheitert, wie angenehm werde
ich mit ihm reisen. Ich bin an seine Sentiments zum Theil schon <ins
class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘go’">so</ins> gewöhnt, sie bis
in das weiche innere Mark seiner Menschheit in ihren zarten Fäden zu
verfolgen: dass ich glaube seinen Tristram etwas mehr zu verstehn als
the common people. Nur um so mehr ärgern mich auch seine verfluchten
Säuereien und Zweideutigkeiten, die das Buch wenigerer Empfehlung fähig
machen als es verdient.” We learn from the same letter that Herder
possessed the sermons of Yorick in the Zürich translation. Herder’s own
homiletical style during this period, as evinced by the sermons
preserved to us, betrays no trace of Sterne’s influence.</p>

<p>Riedel, in his “Theorie der schönen Künste und Wissenschaften,”<a
class = "tag" name = "tagII_48" id = "tagII_48" href =
"#noteII_48">48</a> shows appreciation of Shandy complete and
<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
<a name = "page30" id = "page30"> </a>
discriminating, previous to the publication of the Sentimental Journey.
This book is a sort of compendium, a&nbsp;series of rather disconnected
chapters, woven together out of quotations from aesthetic critics,
examples and comment. In the chapter on Similarity and Contrast he
contends that a satirist only may transgress the rule he has just
enunciated: “When a perfect similarity fails of its effect, a&nbsp;too
far-fetched, a&nbsp;too ingenious one, is even less effective,” and in
this connection he quotes from Tristram Shandy a passage describing the
accident to Dr. Slop and Obadiah.<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_49" id =
"tagII_49" href = "#noteII_49">49</a> Riedel translates the passage
himself. The chapter “Ueber die Laune”<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_50"
id = "tagII_50" href = "#noteII_50">50</a> contains two more references
to Shandy. In a volume dated 1768 and entitled “Ueber das Publikum:
Briefe an einige Glieder desselben,” written evidently without knowledge
of the Journey, Riedel indicates the position which Shandy had in these
years won for itself among a select class. Riedel calls it a
contribution to the “Register” of the human heart and states that he
knows people who claim to have learned more psychology from this novel
than from many thick volumes in which the authors had first killed
sentiment in order then to dissect it at leisure.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagII_51" id = "tagII_51" href = "#noteII_51">51</a></p>

<p>Early in 1763, one finds an appreciative knowledge of Shandy as a
possession of a group of Swiss literati, but probably confined to a
coterie of intellectual aristocrats and novelty-seekers. Julie <ins
class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘Von’">von</ins> Bondeli<a
class = "tag" name = "tagII_52" id = "tagII_52" href =
"#noteII_52">52</a> writes to Usteri from Koenitz on March 10, 1763,
that Kirchberger<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_53" id = "tagII_53" href
= "#noteII_53">53</a> will be able to get him the opportunity to read
Tristram Shandy as a whole, that she herself has read two volumes with
surprise, emotion and almost constant bursts of laughter; she goes on to
say: “Il voudrait la peine d’apprendre l’anglais ne fut-ce que pour lire
cet impayable livre, dont la vérité et le génie se fait sentir à chaque
<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
<a name = "page31" id = "page31"> </a>
ligne au travers de la plus originelle plaisanterie.” Zimmermann was a
resident of Brugg, 1754&ndash;1768, and was an intimate friend of
Fräulein von Bondeli. It may be that this later enthusiastic admirer of
Sterne became acquainted with Shandy at this time through Fräulein von
Bondeli, but their correspondence, covering the years 1761&ndash;1775,
does not disclose&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Dr. Carl Behmer, who has devoted an entire monograph to the study of
Wieland’s connection with Sterne, is of the opinion, and his proofs seem
conclusive, that Wieland did not know Shandy before the autumn of
1767,<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_54" id = "tagII_54" href =
"#noteII_54">54</a> that is, only a few months before the publication of
the Journey. But his enthusiasm was immediate. The first evidence of
acquaintance with Sterne, a&nbsp;letter to Zimmermann (November 13,
1767),<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_55" id = "tagII_55" href =
"#noteII_55">55</a> is full of extravagant terms of admiration and
devotion. One is naturally reminded of his similar extravagant
expressions with reference to the undying worth of Richardson’s novels.
Sterne’s life philosophy fitted in with Wieland’s second literary
period, the frivolous, sensuous, epicurean, even as the moral
meanderings of Richardson agreed with his former serious, religious
attitude. Probably soon after or while reading Shandy, Wieland conceived
the idea of translating it. The letter which contains this very first
mention of Sterne also records Wieland’s regret that the Germans can
read this incomparable original only in so wretched a translation, which
implies a contemporary acquaintance with Dr. Zückert’s rendering. This
regret may well have been the foundation of his own purpose of
translating the book; and knowledge of this seems to have been pretty
general among German men of letters at the time. Though the account of
this purpose would bring us into a time when the Sentimental Journey was
in every hand, it may be as well to complete what we have to say of it
here.</p>

<p>His reason for abandoning the idea, and the amount of work done, the
length of time he spent upon the project, cannot be determined from his
correspondence and must, as Behmer implies, be left in doubt. But
several facts, which Behmer does
<span class = "pagenum">32</span>
<a name = "page32" id = "page32"> </a>
not note, remarks of his own and of his contemporaries, point to more
than an undefined general purpose on his part; it is not improbable that
considerable work was done. Wieland says incidentally in his
<i>Teutscher Merkur</i>,<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_56" id =
"tagII_56" href = "#noteII_56">56</a> in a review of the new edition of
Zückert’s translation: “Vor drei Jahren, da er (Lange) mich bat, ihm die
Uebersetzung des Tristram mit der ich damals umgieng, in Verlag zu
geben.” Herder asks Nicolai in a letter dated Paris, November 30, 1769,
“What is Wieland doing, is he far along with his Shandy?” And in August,
1769, in a letter to Hartknoch, he mentions Wieland’s Tristram among
German books which he longs to read.<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_57"
id = "tagII_57" href = "#noteII_57">57</a></p>

<p>The <i>Jenaische Zeitungen von Gelehrten Sachen</i><a class = "tag"
name = "tagII_58" id = "tagII_58" href = "#noteII_58">58</a> for
December 18, 1769, in mentioning this new edition of Zückert’s
translation, states that Wieland has now given up his intention, but
adds: “Perhaps he will, however, write essays which may fill the place
of a philosophical commentary upon the whole book.” That Wieland had any
such secondary purpose is not elsewhere stated, but it does not seem as
if the journal would have published such a rumor without some foundation
in fact. It may be possibly a resurrection of his former idea of a
defense of Tristram as a part of the “Litteraturbriefe” scheme which
Riedel had proposed.<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_59" id = "tagII_59"
href = "#noteII_59">59</a> This general project having failed, Wieland
may have cherished the purpose of defending Tristram independently of
the plan. Or this may be a reviewer’s vague memory of a former rumor of
plan.</p>

<p>It is worth noting incidentally that Gellert does not seem to have
known Sterne at all. His letters, for example, to Demoiselle Lucius,
which begin October 22, 1760, and continue to December 4, 1769, contain
frequent <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘refrences’">references</ins>
to other English celebrities, but none to Sterne.</p>

<p>The first notice of Sterne’s death is probably that in the
<i>Adress-Comptoir-Nachrichten</i> of Hamburg in the issue of April 6,
1768, not three weeks after the event itself. The brief announcement is
a comparison with Cervantes. The
<span class = "pagenum">33</span>

<i>Göttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen</i> chronicles the death of Yorick,
August 29, 1768.<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_60" id = "tagII_60" href

<p>Though published in England from 1759&ndash;67, Tristram Shandy seems
not to have been reprinted in Germany till the 1772 edition of Richter
in Altenburg, a&nbsp;year later indeed than Richter’s reprint of the
Sentimental Journey. The colorless and inaccurate Zückert translation,
as has already been suggested, achieved no real popular success and won
no learned recognition. The reviews were largely silent or indifferent
to it, and, apart from the comparatively few notices already cited, it
was not mentioned by any important literary periodical until after its
republication by Lange, when the Sentimental Journey had set all tongues
awag with reference to the late lamented Yorick. None of the journals
indicate any appreciation of Sterne’s especial claim to recognition, nor
see in the fatherland any peculiar receptiveness to his appeal. In
short, the foregoing accumulation of particulars resolves itself into
the general statement, easily derived from the facts stated: Sterne’s
position in the German world of letters is due primarily to the
Sentimental Journey. Without its added impulse Shandy would have hardly
stirred the surface of German life and thought. The enthusiasm even of a
few scholars whose learning and appreciation of literature is
international, the occasional message of uncertain understanding, of
doubtful approbation, or of rumored popularity in another land, are not
sufficient to secure a general interest and attentiveness, much less a
literary following. The striking contrast between the essential
characteristics of the two books is a sufficient and wholly reasonable
occasion for Germany’s temporary indifference to the one and her
immediate welcome for the other. Shandy is whimsicality touched with
sentiment. The Sentimental Journey is the record of a sentimental
experience, guided by the caprice of a whimsical will. Whimsicality is a
flower that defies transplanting; when once rooted in other soil it
shoots up into obscurity, masquerading as profundity, or pure silliness
without reason or a smile. The whimsies of one language become amazing
contortions in another. The
<span class = "pagenum">34</span>
<a name = "page34" id = "page34"> </a>
humor of Shandy, though deep-dyed in Sterne’s own eccentricity, is still
essentially British and demands for its appreciation a more extensive
knowledge of British life in its narrowest, most individual phases,
a&nbsp;more intensive sympathy with British attitudes of mind than the
German of the eighteenth century, save in rare instances, possessed.
Bode asserts in the preface to his translation of the Sentimental
Journey that Shandy had been read by a good many Germans, but follows
this remark with the query, “How many have <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘understod’">understood</ins> it?” “One finds
people,” he says, “who despise it as the most nonsensical twaddle, and
cannot comprehend how others, whom they must credit with a good deal of
understanding, wit, and learning, think quite otherwise of it,” and he
closes by noting the necessity that one be acquainted with the follies
of the world, and especially of the British world, to appreciate the
novel. He refers unquestionably to his own circle of literati in
Hamburg, who knew Tristram and cared for it, and to others of his
acquaintance less favored with a knowledge of things English. The
Sentimental Journey presented no inscrutable mystery of purposeful
eccentricity and perplexing personality, but was written large in great
human characters which he who ran might read. And Germany was ready to
give it a welcome.<a class = "tag" name = "tagII_61" id = "tagII_61"

A reviewer in the <i>Frankfurter Gel. Anz.</i>, as early as 1774,
asserts that Sterne had inspired more droll and sentimental imitations

Sterne did, to be sure, assert in a letter (Letters, I, p.&nbsp;34) that
he wrote “not to be fed but to be famous.” Yet this was after this
desire had been fulfilled, and, as the expression agrees with the tone
and purpose of the letter in which it is found, it does not seem
necessary to place too much weight upon it. It is very probable in view
of evidence collected later that Sterne <i>began</i> at least to write
Tristram as a pastime in domestic misfortune. The thirst for fame may
have developed in the progress of the composition.</p>

These two aspects of the Sterne cult in Germany will be more fully
treated later. The historians of literature and other investigators who
have treated Sterne’s influence in Germany have not distinguished very
carefully the difference between Sterne’s two works, and the resulting
difference between the kind and amount of their respective influences.
Appell, however, interprets the condition correctly and assigns the
cause with accuracy and pointedness. (“Werther und seine Zeit.”
p.&nbsp;246). The German critics repeat persistently the thought that
the imitators of Sterne remained as far away from the originals as the
Shakespeare followers from the great Elizabethan. See Gervinus,
Geschichte der deutschen Dichtung, I, 184; Hettner, “Geschichte der
deutschen Literatur im 18. Jahrhundert,” III,&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;362;

CHAPTER III</a><br>
&nbsp;<br>
THE PUBLICATION OF THE SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY</h3>


<p>On February 27, 1768, the Sentimental Journey was published in
London,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_1" id = "tagIII_1" href =
"#noteIII_1">1</a> less than three weeks before the author’s death, and
the book was at once transplanted to German soil, beginning there
immediately its career of commanding influence and wide-spread
popularity.</p>

<p>Several causes operated together in favoring its pronounced and
immediate success. A&nbsp;knowledge of Sterne existed among the more
intelligent lovers of English literature in Germany, the leaders of
thought, whose voice compelled attention for the understandable, but was
powerless to create appreciation for the unintelligible among the lower
ranks of readers. This knowledge and appreciation of Yorick were
immediately available for the furtherance of Sterne’s fame as soon as a
work of popular appeal was published. The then prevailing interest in
travels is, further, not to be overlooked as a forceful factor in
securing immediate recognition for the Sentimental Journey.<a class =
"tag" name = "tagIII_2" id = "tagIII_2" href = "#noteIII_2">2</a> At no
time in the world’s history has the popular interest in books of travel,
containing geographical and topographical description, and information
concerning peoples and customs, been greater than during this period.
The presses teemed with stories of wanderers in known and unknown lands.
The preface to the <i>Neue Zeitungen von Gelehrten Sachen</i> of Leipzig
for the year 1759 heralds as a
<span class = "pagenum">36</span>
<a name = "page36" id = "page36"> </a>
matter of importance a gain in geographical description. The
<i>Jenaische Zeitungen von Gelehrten Sachen</i>, 1773, makes in its
tables of contents, a&nbsp;separate division of travels. In 1759, also,
the “Allgemeine Historie der Reisen zu Wasser und zu Lande” (Leipzig,
1747&ndash;1774), reached its seventeenth volume. These are brief
indications among numerous similar instances of the then predominant
interest in the wanderer’s experience. Sterne’s second work of fiction,
though differing in its nature so materially from other books of travel,
may well, even if only from the allurement of its title, have shared the
general enthusiasm for the traveler’s narrative. Most important,
however, is the direct appeal of the book itself, irresistible to the
German mind and heart. Germany had been for a decade hesitating on the
verge of tears, and grasped with eagerness a book which seemed to give
her British sanction for indulgence in her lachrymose desire.</p>

<p>The portion of Shandy which is virtually a part of the Sentimental
Journey,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_3" id = "tagIII_3" href =
"#noteIII_3">3</a> which Sterne, possibly to satisfy the demands of the
publisher, thrust in to fill out volumes contracted for, was not long
enough, nor distinctive enough in its use of sentiment, was too
effectually concealed in its volume of Shandean quibbles, to win readers
for the whole of Shandy, or to direct wavering attention through the
mazes of Shandyism up to the point where the sentimental Yorick really
takes up the pen and introduces the reader to the sad fate of Maria of
Moulines. One can imagine eager Germany aroused to sentimental frenzy
over the Maria incident in the Sentimental Journey, turning with
throbbing contrition to the forgotten, neglected, or unknown passage in
Tristram Shandy.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_4" id = "tagIII_4" href
= "#noteIII_4">4</a></p>

<p>It is difficult to trace sources for Sterne in English letters, that
is, for the strange combination of whimsicality, genuine sentiment and
knavish smiles, which is the real Sterne. He is individual, exotic, not
demonstrable from preceding literary conditions, and his meteoric, or
rather rocket-like career in Britain is in its decline a proof of the
insensibility of the English people to a large portion of his gospel.
The creature of
<span class = "pagenum">37</span>
<a name = "page37" id = "page37"> </a>
fancy which, by a process of elimination, the Germans made out of Yorick
is more easily explicable from existing and preceding literary and
emotional conditions in Germany.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_5" id =
"tagIII_5" href = "#noteIII_5">5</a> Brockes had prepared the way for a
sentimental view of nature, Klopstock’s poetry had fostered the display
of emotion, the analysis of human feeling. Gellert had spread his own
sort of religious and ethical sentimentalism among the multitudes of his
devotees. Stirred by, and contemporaneous with Gallic feeling, Germany
was turning with longing toward the natural man, that is, man unhampered
by convention and free to follow the dictates of the primal emotions.
The exercise of human sympathy was a goal of this movement. In this
vague, uncertain awakening, this dangerous freeing of human feelings,
Yorick’s practical illustration of the sentimental life could not but
prove an incentive, an organizer, a&nbsp;relief for pent-up emotion.<a

<p>Johann Joachim Christoph Bode has already been mentioned in relation
to the early review of Zückert’s translation of Shandy. His connection
with the rapid growth of the Yorick cult after the publication of the
Sentimental Journey demands a more extended account of this German
apostle of Yorick. In the sixth volume of Bode’s translation of
Montaigne<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_7" id = "tagIII_7" href =
"#noteIII_7">7</a> was printed first the life of the translator by
C.&nbsp;A. Böttiger. This
<span class = "pagenum">38</span>
<a name = "page38" id = "page38"> </a>
was published the following year by the same house in a separate volume
entitled “J.&nbsp;J. C.&nbsp;Bodes literarisches Leben, nebst dessen
Bildnis von Lips.” All other sources of information regarding Bode, such
as the accounts in Jördens and in Schlichtegroll’s “Nekrolog,”<a class =
"tag" name = "tagIII_8" id = "tagIII_8" href = "#noteIII_8">8</a> are
derivations or abstracts from this biography. Bode was born in
Braunschweig in 1730; reared in lowly circumstances and suffering
various vicissitudes of fortune, he came to Hamburg in 1756&ndash;7.
Gifted with a talent for languages, which he had cultivated assiduously,
he was regarded at the time of his arrival, even in Hamburg, as one
especially conversant with the English language and literature. His
nature must have borne something akin to Yorick, for his biographer
describes his position in Hamburg society as not dissimilar to that once
occupied for a brief space in the London world by the clever fêted
Sterne. Yet the enthusiasm of the friend as biographer doubtless colors
the case, forcing a parallel with Yorick by sheer necessity. Before 1768
Bode had published several translations from the English with rather
dubious success, and the adaptability of the Sentimental Journey to
German uses must have occurred to him, or have been suggested to him
directly upon its very importation into Germany. He undoubtedly set
himself to the task of translation as soon as the book reached his
hands, for, in the issue of the <i>Hamburgische
Adress-Comptoir-Nachrichten</i> for April 20, is found Bode’s
translation of a section from the Sentimental Journey. “Die Bettler” he
names the extract; it is really the fifth of the sections which Sterne
labels “Montriul.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_9" id = "tagIII_9"
href = "#noteIII_9">9</a> In the numbers of the same paper for June 11
and 15, Bode translates in two parts the story of the “Monk;” thus, in
but little over three months after its English publication, the story of
the poor Franciscan Lorenzo and his fateful snuff-box was transferred to
Germany and began its heart-touching career. These excerpts were
included by Bode later in the year when he published his translation of
the whole Sentimental
<span class = "pagenum">39</span>
<a name = "page39" id = "page39"> </a>
Journey. The first extract was evidently received with favor and
interest, for, in the foreword to the translation of the “Monk,” in the
issue of June 11, Bode assigns this as his reason for making his readers
better acquainted with this worthy book. He further says that the reader
of taste and insight will not fail to distinguish the difference when so
fine a connoisseur of the human heart as Sterne depicts sentiments, and
when a shallow wit prattles of his emotions. Bode’s last words are a
covert assumption of his rôle as prophet and priest of Yorick in
Germany: “The reader may himself judge from the following passage,
whether we have spoken of our Briton in terms of too high praise.”</p>

<p>In the July number of the <i>Unterhaltungen</i>, another Hamburg
periodical, is printed another translation from the Sentimental Journey
entitled: “Eine Begebenheit aus Yoricks Reise fürs Herz übersetzt.” The
episode is that of the <i>fille de chambre</i><a class = "tag" name =
"tagIII_10" id = "tagIII_10" href = "#noteIII_10">10</a> who is seeking
Crébillon’s “Les Egarements du Coeur et de l’Esprit.” The translator
omits the first part of the section and introduces us to the story with
a few unacknowledged words of his own. In the September number of the
same periodical the rest of the <i>fille de chambre</i> story<a class =
"tag" name = "tagIII_11" id = "tagIII_11" href = "#noteIII_11">11</a> is
narrated. Here also the translator alters the beginning of the account
to make it less abrupt in the rendering. The author of this translation
has not been determined. Bode does not translate the word “Sentimental”
in his published extracts, giving merely the English title; hence
Lessing’s advice<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_12" id = "tagIII_12"
href = "#noteIII_12">12</a> concerning the rendering of the word dates
probably from the latter part of the summer. The translation in the
September number of the <i>Unterhaltungen</i> also does not contain a
rendering of the word. Bode’s complete translation was issued probably
in October,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_13" id = "tagIII_13" href =
"#noteIII_13">13</a> possibly late in September, 1768, and bore the
imprint of the publisher Cramer in Hamburg and Bremen, but
<span class = "pagenum">40</span>
<a name = "page40" id = "page40"> </a>
the volumes were printed at Bode’s own press and were entitled “Yoricks
Empfindsame Reise durch Frankreich und Italien, aus dem Englischen
übersetzt.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_14" id = "tagIII_14" href =
"#noteIII_14">14</a></p>

<p>The translator’s preface occupies twenty pages and is an important
document in the story of Sterne’s popularity in Germany, since it
represents the introductory battle-cry of the Sterne cult, and
illustrates the attitude of cultured Germany toward the new star. Bode
begins his foreword with Lessing’s well-known statement of his devotion
to Sterne. Bode does not name Lessing; calls him “a&nbsp;well-known
German scholar.” The statement referred to was made when Bode brought to
his friend the news of Sterne’s death. It is worth repeating:</p>

<p>“I would gladly have resigned to him five years of my own life, if
such a thing were possible, though I had known with certainty that I had
only ten, or even eight left.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but under the
condition that he must keep on writing, no matter what, life and
opinions, or sermons, or journeys.” On July 5, 1768, Lessing wrote to
Nicolai, commenting on Winckelmann’s death as follows: “He is the second
author within a short time, to whom I would have gladly given some years
of my own life.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_15" id = "tagIII_15"
href = "#noteIII_15">15</a></p>

<p>Nearly thirty years later (March 20, 1797) Sara Wulf, whose maiden
name was Meyer and who was later and better known as Frau von Grotthus,
wrote from Dresden to Goethe of the consolation found in “Werther” after
a disappointing youthful love affair, and of Lessing’s conversation with
her then concerning Goethe. She reports Lessing’s words as follows: “You
will feel sometime what a genius Goethe is, I&nbsp;am sure of this.
I&nbsp;have always said I would give ten years of my own life if I had
been able to lengthen Sterne’s by one year, but Goethe consoles me in
some measure for his loss.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_16" id =
"tagIII_16" href = "#noteIII_16">16</a></p>

<p>It would be absurd to attach any importance to this variation of
statement. It does not indicate necessarily an affection for Sterne and
a regret at his loss, mathematically doubled in these seven or eight
years between Sterne’s death and the time of Lessing’s conversation with
Sara Meyer; it probably arises
<span class = "pagenum">41</span>
<a name = "page41" id = "page41"> </a>
from a failure of memory on the part of the lady, for Bode’s narrative
of the anecdote was printed but a few months after Sterne’s death, and
Lessing made no effort to correct an inaccuracy of statement, if such
were the case, though he lived to see four editions of Bode’s
translation and consequently so many repetitions of his expressed but
impossible desire. Erich Schmidt<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_17" id =
"tagIII_17" href = "#noteIII_17">17</a> reduces this willingness on
Lessing’s part to one year,&mdash;an unwarranted liberty.</p>

<p>These two testimonies of Lessing’s devotion are of importance in
defining his attitude toward Yorick. They attest the fact that this was
no passing fancy, no impulsive thought uttered on the moment when the
news of Sterne’s death was brought to him, and when the Sentimental
Journey could have been but a few weeks in his hands, but a deep-seated
desire, born of reflection and continued admiration.<a class = "tag"
name = "tagIII_18" id = "tagIII_18" href = "#noteIII_18">18</a> The
addition of the word “Reisen” in Bode’s narrative is significant, for it
shows that Lessing must have become acquainted with the Sentimental
Journey before April 6, the date of the notice of Sterne’s death in the
<i>Hamburgische Adress-Comptoir-Nachrichten</i><ins class = "correction"
title = "superfluous ”">;<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_19" id =
"tagIII_19" href = "#noteIII_19">19</a></ins> that is, almost
immediately after its English publication, unless Bode, in his
enthusiasm for the book which he was offering the public, inserted the
word unwarrantably in Lessing’s statement.</p>

<p>To return to Bode’s preface. With emphatic protestations, disclaiming
vanity in appealing to the authority of so distinguished a friend, Bode
proceeds to relate more in detail Lessing’s connection with his
endeavor. He does not say that Lessing suggested the translation to him,
though his account has been interpreted to mean that, and this fact has
been generally accepted by the historians of literature and the
biographers
<span class = "pagenum">42</span>
<a name = "page42" id = "page42"> </a>
of Lessing.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_20" id = "tagIII_20" href =
"#noteIII_20">20</a> The tone of Bode’s preface, however, rather implies
the contrary, and no other proof of the supposition is available. What
Bode does assert is merely that the name of the scholar whom he quotes
as having expressed a willingness to give a part of his own life if
Sterne’s literary activity might be continued, would create a favorable
prepossession for his original (“ein günstiges Vorurtheil”), and that a
translator is often fortunate enough if his selection of a book to
translate is not censured. All this implies, on Lessing’s part, only an
approval of Bode’s choice, a&nbsp;fact which would naturally follow from
the remarkable statement of esteem in the preceding sentence. Bode says
further that out of friendship for him and regard for the reader of
taste, this author (Lessing), had taken the trouble to go through the
whole translation, and then he adds the conventional request in such
circumstances, that the errors remaining may be attributed to the
translator and not to the friend.</p>

<p>The use of the epithet “empfindsam” for “sentimental” is then the
occasion for some discussion, and its source is one of the facts
involved in Sterne’s German vogue which seem to have fastened themselves
on the memory of literature. Bode had in the first place translated the
English term by “sittlich,” a&nbsp;manifestly insufficient if not flatly
incorrect rendering, but his friend coined the word “empfindsam” for the
occasion and Bode quotes Lessing’s own words on the subject:</p>

<p>“Bemerken Sie sodann dass sentimental ein neues Wort ist.
<span class = "pagenum">43</span>
<a name = "page43" id = "page43"> </a>
War es Sternen erlaubt, sich ein neues Wort zu bilden, so muss es eben
darum auch seinem Uebersetzer erlaubt seyn. Die Engländer hatten gar
kein Adjectivum von Sentiment: wir haben von Empfindung mehr als eines,
empfindlich, empfindbar, empfindungsreich, aber diese sagen alle etwas
anders. Wagen Sie, empfindsam! Wenn eine mühsame Reise eine Reise
heisst, bey der viel Mühe ist: so kann ja auch eine empfindsame Reise
eine Reise heissen, <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘be’">bey</ins>
der viel Empfindung war. Ich will nicht sagen, dass Sie
die Analogie ganz auf ihrer Seite haben dürften. Aber was die Leser vors
erste bey dem Worte noch nicht denken mögen, sie sich nach und nach
dabey zu denken gewöhnen.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_21" id =
"tagIII_21" href = "#noteIII_21">21</a></p>

<p>The statement that Sterne coined the word “sentimental” is
undoubtedly incorrect,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_22" id =
"tagIII_22" href = "#noteIII_22">22</a> but no one seems to have
discovered and corrected the error till Nicolai’s article on Sterne in
the <i>Berlinische Monatsschrift</i> for February, 1795, in which it is
shown that the word had been used in older English novels, in “Sir
Charles Grandison” indeed.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_23" id =
"tagIII_23" href = "#noteIII_23">23</a> It may well be that, as <ins
class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘Bottiger’">Böttiger</ins>
hints,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_24" id = "tagIII_24" href =
"#noteIII_24">24</a> the coining of the word “empfindsam” was suggested
to Lessing by Abbt’s similar formation of “empfindnisz.”<a class = "tag"
name = "tagIII_25" id = "tagIII_25" href = "#noteIII_25">25</a></p>

<p>The preface to this first edition of Bode’s translation of the
Sentimental Journey contains, further, a&nbsp;sketch of Sterne’s life,<a
class = "tag" name = "tagIII_26" id = "tagIII_26" href =
"#noteIII_26">26</a> his character and his works. Bode relates the
familiar
<span class = "pagenum">44</span>
<a name = "page44" id = "page44"> </a>
story of the dog, but misses the point entirely in rendering “puppy” by
“Geck” in Sterne’s reply, “So lang er ein Geck ist.” The watchcoat
episode is narrated, and a brief account is given of Sterne’s fortunes
in London with Tristram Shandy and the sermons. Allusion has already
been made to the hints thrown out in this sketch relative to the reading
of Sterne in Germany. A&nbsp;translation from Shandy of the passage
descriptive of Parson Yorick serves as a portrait for Sterne.</p>

<p>A second edition of Bode’s work was published in 1769. The preface,
which is dated “Anfang des Monats Mai, 1769,” is in the main identical
with the first, but has some significant additions. A&nbsp;word is said
relative to his controversy with a critic, which is mentioned later.<a
class = "tag" name = "tagIII_27" id = "tagIII_27" href =
"#noteIII_27">27</a> Bode confesses further that the excellence of his
work is due to Ebert and Lessing,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_28" id
= "tagIII_28" href = "#noteIII_28">28</a> though modesty compelled his
silence in the previous preface concerning the source of his aid. Bode
admits that even this disclosure is prompted by the clever guess of a
critic in the <i>Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent</i>,<a
class = "tag" name = "tagIII_29" id = "tagIII_29" href =
"#noteIII_29">29</a> who openly named Lessing as the scholar referred to
in the first introduction. The addition and prominence of Ebert’s name
is worthy of note, for in spite of the plural mention<a class = "tag"
name = "tagIII_30" id = "tagIII_30" href = "#noteIII_30">30</a> in the
appendix to the introduction, his first acknowledgment is to one friend
only and there is no suggestion of another counselor. Ebert’s connection
with the Bode translation has been overlooked in the distribution of
influence, while the memorable coining of the new word, supplemented by
Böttiger’s unsubstantiated statements, has emphasized Lessing’s service
in this regard. Ebert is well-known as an intelligent and appreciative
student of English literature, and as a translator, but his own works
betray no trace of imitation or admiration of Sterne.</p>

<p>The final words of this new preface promise a translation of the
continuation of the Sentimental Journey; the spurious volumes of
Eugenius are, of course, the ones meant here. This
<span class = "pagenum">45</span>
<a name = "page45" id = "page45"> </a>
introduction to the second edition remains unchanged in the subsequent
ones. The text of the second edition was substantially an exact
reproduction of the first, but Bode allowed himself frequent minor
changes of word or phrase, an alteration occurring on an average once in
about three pages. Bode’s changes are in general the result of a
polishing or filing process, in the interest of elegance of discourse,
or accuracy of translation. Bode acknowledges that some of the
corrections were those suggested by a reviewer,<a class = "tag" name =
"tagIII_31" id = "tagIII_31" href = "#noteIII_31">31</a> but states that
other passages criticised were allowed to stand as they were. He says
further that he would have asked those friends who had helped him on his
translation itself to aid him in the alterations, if distance and other
conditions had allowed. The reference here is naturally to his
separation from Ebert, who was in Braunschweig, but the other
“conditions” which could prevent a continuation of Lessing’s interest in
the translation and his assistance in revision are not evident. Lessing
was in Hamburg during this period, and hence his advice was
available.</p>

<p>Bode’s retranslation of the passage with which Sterne’s work closed
shows increased perception and appreciation for the subtleness of
Sterne’s indecent suggestions, or, perhaps, a&nbsp;growing lack of
timidity or scruple in boldly repeating them. It is probable that the
continuation by Eugenius, which had come into his hands during this
period, had, with its resumption of the point, reminded Bode of the
inadequacy and inexactness of his previous rendering.</p>

<p>At almost precisely the same time that Bode’s translation appeared,
another German rendering was published, a&nbsp;fact which in itself is
significant for the determination of the relative strength of appeal as
between Sterne’s two works of fiction. The title<a class = "tag" name =
"tagIII_32" id = "tagIII_32" href = "#noteIII_32">32</a> of this version
was “Versuch über die menschliche
<span class = "pagenum">46</span>
<a name = "page46" id = "page46"> </a>
Natur in Herrn Yoricks, Verfasser des Tristram Shandy, Reisen durch
Frankreich und Italien, aus dem Englischen.” It was dated 1769 and was
published at the “Fürstliche Waisenhausbuchhandlung,” in Braunschweig.
The preface is signed Braunschweig, September 7, 1768, and the book was
issued in September or October. The anonymous translator was Pastor
Mittelstedt<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_33" id = "tagIII_33" href =
"#noteIII_33">33</a> in Braunschweig (Hirsching und Jördens say
Hofprediger), whom the partisan Böttiger calls the ever-ready
manufacturer of translations (der allezeit fertige
Uebersetzungsfabrikant). Behmer tentatively suggests Weis as the
translator of this early rendering, an error into which he is led
evidently by a remark in Bode’s preface in which the apologetic
translator states the rumor that Weis was engaged in translating the
same book, and that he (Bode) would surely have locked up his work in
his desk if the publisher had not thereby been led to suffer loss.
Nothing was ever heard of this third translation.</p>

<p>This first edition of the Mittelstedt translation contains 248 pages
and is supplied with a preface which is, like Bode’s, concerned in
considerable measure with the perplexing problem of the translation of
Sterne’s title. The English title is given and the word “sentimental” is
declared a new one in England and untranslatable in German. Mittelstedt
proposes “Gefühlvolle Reisen,” “Reisen fürs Herz,” “Philosophische
Reisen,” and then condemns his own suggestions as indeterminate and
forced. He then goes on to say, “So I have chosen the title which Yorick
himself suggests in the first part.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_34"
id = "tagIII_34" href = "#noteIII_34">34</a> He speaks of the lavish
praise already bestowed on this book by the learned journals, and turns
at last aside to do the obvious: he bemoans Sterne’s death by quoting
Hamlet and closes with an apostrophe to Sterne translated from the April
number of the <i>Monthly Review</i> for 1768.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagIII_35" id = "tagIII_35" href = "#noteIII_35">35</a> In 1769, the
year when the first
<span class = "pagenum">47</span>
<a name = "page47" id = "page47"> </a>
edition was dated, the Mittelstedt translation was published under a
slightly altered title, as already mentioned. This second edition of the
Mittelstedt translation in the same year as the first is overlooked by
Jördens and Hirsching,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_36" id =
"tagIII_36" href = "#noteIII_36">36</a> both of whom give a second and
hence really a third edition in 1774. Böttiger notes with partisan zeal
that Bode’s translation was made use of in some of the alterations of
this second edition, and further records the fact that the account of
Sterne’s life, added in this edition, was actually copied from Bode’s
preface.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_37" id = "tagIII_37" href =
"#noteIII_37">37</a></p>

<p>The publication of the Mittelstedt translation was the occasion of a
brief controversy between the two translators in contemporary journals.
Mittelstedt printed his criticism of Bode’s work in a home paper, the
<i>Braunschweiger Intelligenzblätter</i>, and Bode spoke out his defense
in the <i>Neue Hamburger Zeitung</i>. That Bode in his second edition
adopted some of the reviewer’s suggestions and criticisms has been
noted, but in the preface to this edition he declines to resume the
strife in spite of general expectation of it, but, as a final shot, he
delivers himself of “an article from his critical creed,” that the
“critic is as little infallible as author or translator,” which seems,
at any rate, a&nbsp;rather pointless and insignificant contribution to
the controversy.</p>

<p>Bode’s translation of the third and fourth volumes of Yorick’s
Journey,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_38" id = "tagIII_38" href =
"#noteIII_38">38</a> that is, the continuation by Eugenius, followed
directly after the announcement in the preface to the second edition of
the first two volumes, as already mentioned. Böttiger states that Bode
had this continuation from Alberti and knew it before anyone else in
Germany. It was published in England in the spring of 1769, and was
greeted with a disapproval which was quite general, and it never enjoyed
there
<span class = "pagenum">48</span>
<a name = "page48" id = "page48"> </a>
any considerable genuine popularity or recognition. Bode published this
translation of Stevenson’s work without any further word of comment or
explanation whatsoever, a&nbsp;fact which easily paved the way for a
misunderstanding relative to the volumes, for Bode was frequently
regarded as their author and held responsible for their defects. Bode
himself never made any satisfactory or adequate explanation of his
attitude toward these volumes, and the reply to Goeze in the
introduction to his translation of Shandy is the nearest approach to a
discussion of his position. But there Bode is concerned only with the
attack made by the Hamburg pastor upon his character, an inference drawn
from the nature of the book translated, and the character of the
translation; in the absence of a new edition in which “Mine and His
shall be marked off by distinct boundaries,” he asks Goeze only to send
to him, and beg “for original and translation,” naturally for the
purpose of comparison. This evasive reply is Bode’s only defense or
explanation. Böttiger claims that the review of Bode’s translation in the
<i><ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘Allegemeine’">Allgemeine</ins>
deutsche Bibliothek</i> did much to spread the idea of Bode’s authorship, though the reviewer in that
periodical<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_39" id = "tagIII_39" href =
"#noteIII_39">39</a> only suggests the possibility of German authorship,
a&nbsp;suspicion aroused by the substitution of German customs and motif
and word-play, together with contemporary literary allusion, allusion to
literary mediocrities and obscurities, of such a nature as to preclude
the possibility of the book’s being a literal translation from the
English.</p>

<p>The exact amount and the nature of Bode’s divergence from the
original, his alterations and additions, have never been definitely
stated by anyone. The reviewer in the <i>Allgemeine deutsche
Bibliothek</i> is manifestly ignorant of the original. Böttiger is
indefinite and partisan, yet his statement of the facts has been <ins
class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘generaly’">generally</ins>
accepted and constantly repeated. He admits the German coloring given
the translation by Bode through German allusions and German word-plays:
he says that Bode allowed himself these liberties, feeling that he was
no longer dealing with Sterne, a&nbsp;statement of motive on Bode’s
<span class = "pagenum">49</span>
<a name = "page49" id = "page49"> </a>
part which the latter never makes and never hints at. The only absolute
additions which Böttiger mentions as made by Bode to the narrative of
Eugenius are the episode, “Das Hündchen,” and the digression, “Die
Moral.” The erroneous idea herein implied has been caught up and
repeated by nearly everyone who has mentioned Bode’s translation of the
work.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_40" id = "tagIII_40" href =
"#noteIII_40">40</a> The less certain allusion to “Die Moral” has been
lost sight of, and “Das Hündchen” alone has been remembered as
representing this activity on Bode’s part. In fact this episode is only
one of many pure creations on Bode’s part and one of the briefer. In the
first pages of these volumes Bode is faithful to the original,
a&nbsp;fact suggesting that examination or comparison of the original
text and Bode’s translation was never carried beyond the first two-score
pages; yet here, it would seem, Bode’s rendering was less careful, more
open to censure for inaccuracy, than in the previous volumes.<a class =
"tag" name = "tagIII_41" id = "tagIII_41" href =
"#noteIII_41">41</a></p>

<p>This method of translation obtains up to page 48, then Bode omits a
half-page of half-innocent, half-revolting suggestion, the story of the
Cordelier, and from the middle of page 49 to page 75, twenty-five pages,
the translator adds material absolutely his own. This fiction,
introducing Yorick’s sentimental attitude toward the snuff-box, resuming
a sentimental episode in Sterne’s work, full of tears and sympathy, is
especially characteristic of Yorick, as the Germans conceived him. The
story
<span class = "pagenum">50</span>
<a name = "page50" id = "page50"> </a>
is entitled “Das Mündel,”<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_42" id =
"tagIII_42" href = "#noteIII_42">42</a> “The Ward,” and is evidently
intended as a masculine companion-piece to the fateful story of Maria of
Moulines, linked to it even in the actual narrative itself. An
unfortunate, half-crazed man goes about in silence, performing little
services in an inn where Yorick finds lodging. The hostess tells his
story. He was once the brilliant son of the village miller, was
well-educated and gifted with scholarly interests and attainments. While
instructing some children at Moulines, he meets a peasant girl, and love
is born between them. An avaricious brother opposes Jacques’s passion
and ultimately confines him in secret, spreading the report in Moulines
of his faithlessness to his love. After a tragedy has released Jacques
from his unnatural bondage, he learns of his loved one’s death and loses
his mental balance through grief. Such an addition to the brief pathos
of Maria’s story, as narrated by Sterne, such a forced explanation of
the circumstances, is peculiarly commonplace and inartistic. Sterne
instinctively closed the episode with sufficient allowance for the
exercise of the imagination.</p>

<p>Following this addition, the section “Slander” of the original is
omitted. The story of the adventure with the opera-girl is much changed.
The bald indecency of the narrative is somewhat softened by minor
substitutions and omissions. Nearly two pages are inserted here, in
which Yorick discourses on the difference between a sentimental traveler
and an <i>avanturier</i>. On pages 122&ndash;126, the famous “Hündchen”
episode is narrated, an insertion taking the place of the hopelessly
vulgar “Rue Tireboudin.” According to this narrative, Yorick, after the
fire, enters a home where he finds a boy weeping over a dead dog and
refusing to be comforted with promises of other canine possessions. The
critics united in praising this as being a positive addition to the
Yorick adventures, as conceived and related in Sterne’s finest manner.
After the lapse of more than a century, one can acknowledge the pathos,
the humanity of the incident, but the manner is not that of Sterne. It
is a simple, straight-forward relation of the touching incident,
introducing
<span class = "pagenum">51</span>
<a name = "page51" id = "page51"> </a>
that element of the sentimental movement which bears in Germany a close
relation to Yorick, and was exploited, perhaps, more than any other
feature of his creed, as then interpreted, <i>i.e.</i>, the sentimental
regard for the lower animals.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_43" id =
"tagIII_43" href = "#noteIII_43">43</a> But there is lacking here the
inevitable concomitant of Sterne’s relation of a sentimental situation,
the whimsicality of the narrator in his attitude at the time of the
adventure, or reflective whimsicality in the narration. Sterne is always
whimsically quizzical in his conduct toward a sentimental condition, or
toward himself in the analysis of his conduct.</p>

<p>After the “Vergebene Nachforschung” (Unsuccessful Inquiry), which
agrees with the original, Bode adds two pages covering the touching
solicitude of La Fleur for his master’s safety. This addition is, like
the “Hündchen” episode, just mentioned, of considerable significance,
for it illustrates another aspect of Sterne’s sentimental attitude
toward human relations, which appealed to the Germany of these decades
and was extensively copied; the connection between master and man.
Following this added incident, Bode omits completely three sections of
Eugenius’s original narrative, “The Definition,” “Translation of a
Fragment” and “An Anecdote;” all three are brief and at the same time of
baldest, most revolting indecency. In all, Bode’s direct additions
amount in this first volume to about thirty-three pages out of one
hundred and forty-two. The divergences from the original are in the
second volume (the fourth as numbered from Sterne’s genuine Journey)
more marked and extensive: above fifty pages are entirely Bode’s own,
and the individual alterations in word, phrase, allusion and sentiment
are more numerous and unwarranted. The more significant of Bode’s
additions are here noted. “Die Moral” (pages 32&ndash;37) contains a
fling at Collier, the author of a mediocre English translation of
Klopstock’s “Messias,” and another against Kölbele, a&nbsp;contemporary
German

<p>Eugenius’s chapter, “Vendredi-Saint,” Bode sees fit to alter in a
rather extraordinary way, by changing the personnel and giving it quite
another introduction. He inserts here a brief account of Walter Shandy,
his disappointment at Tristram’s calamitous nose and Tristram’s name,
and his resolve to perfect his son’s education; and then he makes the
visit to M’lle Laborde, as narrated by Eugenius, an episode out of
Walter Shandy’s book, which was written for Tristram’s instruction, and,
according to Bode, was delivered for safe-keeping into Yorick’s hands.
Bode changes M’lle Laborde into M’lle Gillet, and Walter Shandy is her
visitor, not Yorick. Bode allows himself some verbal changes and softens
the bald suggestion at the end. Bode’s motive for this startling change
is not clear beyond question. The most plausible theory is that the open
and gross suggestion of immoral relation between Yorick, the clergyman
and moralist, and the Paris maiden, seemed to Bode inconsistent with the
then current acceptation of Yorick’s character; and hence he preferred
by artifice to foist the misdemeanor on to the elder Shandy.</p>

<p>The second extensive addition of Bode’s in this volume is the section
called “Die Erklärung,” and its continuation in the two following
divisions, a&nbsp;story which unites itself with the “Fragment” in
Sterne’s original narration. Yorick is ill and herbs are brought to him
in paper wrappings which turn out to contain the story of the decayed
gentleman, which, according to Sterne’s relation, the Notary was
beginning to write. It will be remembered that the introduction in
Sterne was also brought by La Fleur as a bit of wrapping paper. This
curious coincidence, this prosaic resumption of the broken narrative, is
naïve at least, but can hardly commend itself to any critic as being
other than commonplace and bathetic. The story itself,
<span class = "pagenum">53</span>
<a name = "page53" id = "page53"> </a>
as related by the dying man is a tale of accidental incest told quietly,
earnestly, but without a suggestion of Sterne’s wit or sentiment.</p>

<p>In the next section, emanating entirely from Bode, “Vom
Gesundheitstrinken,” the author is somewhat more successful in catching
the spirit of Sterne in his buoyancy, and in his whimsical anecdote
telling: it purports to be an essay by the author’s friend, Grubbius.
The last addition made by Bode<a class = "tag" name = "tagIII_45" id =
"tagIII_45" href = "#noteIII_45">45</a> introduces once more Yorick’s
sentiment relative to man’s treatment of the animal world. Yorick,
walking in the garden of an acquaintance, shoots a sparrow and meets
with reproof from the owner of the garden. Yorick protests prosaically
that it was only a sparrow, yet on being assured that it was also a
living being, he succumbs to vexation and self-reproof at his own
failure to be true to his own higher self. A&nbsp;similar regret,
a&nbsp;similar remorse at sentimental thoughtlessness, is recorded of
the real Yorick in connection with the Franciscan, Lorenzo. But there is
present in Sterne’s story the inevitable element of caprice in thought
or action, the whimsical inconsistency of varying moods, not a mere
commonplace lapse from a sentimental creed. In one case, Yorick errs
through whim, in the other, merely through heedlessness.</p>

<p>Bode’s attitude toward the continuation of Eugenius and the general
nature of his additions have been suggested by the above account.
A&nbsp;résumé of the omissions and the verbal changes would indicate
that they were made frequently because of the indecency of the original;
the transference of the immorality in the episode of M’lle. Laborde and
Walter Shandy, if the reason above suggested be allowed, is further
proof of Bode’s solicitude for Yorick’s moral reputation. Yet the
retention of the episode “Les Gants d’Amour” in its entirety, and of
parts of the continued story of the Piedmontese, may seem inconsistent
and irreconcilable with any absolute objection on Bode’s part other than
a quantitative one, to this loathesome element of the Eugenius
narrative.</p>

The reviewer in the <i>Allg. deutsche Bibl.</i> (Anhang I-XII, vol. II,
p.&nbsp;896) implies a contemporary cognizance of this aid to its
popularity. He notes the interest in accounts of travels and fears that
some readers will be disappointed after taking up the book. Some French
books of travel, notably Chapelle’s “Voyage en Provence,” 1656, were
read with appreciation by cultivated Germany and had their influence
parallel and auxiliary to Sterne’s.</p>

The emotional groundwork in Germany which furthered the appreciation of
the Journey, and the sober sanity of British common sense which choked
its English sweep, are admirably and typically illustrated in the story
of the meeting of Fanny Burney and Sophie la Roche, as told in the diary
of the former (“The Diary and Letters of Frances Burney, Madame
D’Arblay,” Boston, 1880, I, p.&nbsp;291), entries for September 11 and
17, 1786. On their second meeting Mme. D’Arblay writes of the German
sentimentalist: “Madame la Roche then rising and fixing her eyes filled
with tears on my face, while she held both my hands, in the most melting
accents exclaimed, ‘Miss Borni, la plus chère, la plus digne des
Anglaises, dites&mdash;moi&mdash;m’aimez vous?’” Miss Burney is quite
sensibly frank in her inability to fathom this imbecility. Ludmilla
Assing (“Sophie la Roche,” Berlin, 1859, pp. 273&ndash;280) calls Miss
Burney cold and petty.</p>

So heartily did the Germans receive the Sentimental Journey that it was
felt ere long to be almost a German book. The author of “Ueber die

among German stories and narratives (pp. 177&ndash;9) along with

It is not possible to date with absolute certainty the time of Lessing’s
conversation with Sara Meyer, but it was after the publication of

Böttiger in his biographical sketch of Bode is the first to make this
statement (p.&nbsp;lxiii), and the spread of the idea and its general
acceptation are directly traceable to his authority. The <i>Neue Bibl.
der schönen Wissenschaften</i> in its review of Böttiger’s work repeats
the statement (LVIII, p.&nbsp;97), and it is again repeated by Jördens
(I, p.&nbsp;114, edition of 1806), by Danzel-Guhrauer with express
mention of Böttiger (“Lessing, sein Leben und seine Werke,” II. Erste
Abtheilung, p.&nbsp;287), and by Erich Schmidt (“Lessing, Geschichte
seines Lebens und seiner Schriften,” Berlin, 1899, I, p.&nbsp;674). The
editor of the Hempel edition, VII, p.&nbsp;553 claims Lessing as
responsible for the translation of the Journey, and also of Shandy. The
success of the “Empfindsame Reise” and the popularity of Sterne are
quite enough to account for the latter translation and there is no
evidence of urging on Lessing’s part. A&nbsp;similar statement is found
in Gervinus (V, p.&nbsp;194). The <i>Frankfurter Gel. Anz.</i> (Apr. 21,
1775), p.&nbsp;267, credits Wieland with having urged Bode to translate
Shandy. The <i>Neue Critische Nachrichten, Greifswald</i>, IX,
p.&nbsp;279, makes the same statement. The article, however, in the
<i>Teutscher Merkur</i> (1773, II, pp. 228&ndash;30) expresses merely a
great satisfaction that Bode is engaged upon the work, and gives some
suggestions to him about&nbsp;it.</p>

Strangely enough the first use of this word which has been found is in
one of Sterne’s letters, written in 1740 to the lady who subsequently
became his wife. (Letters, p.&nbsp;25). But these letters were not
published till 1775, long after the word was in common use. An obscure
Yorkshire clergyman can not be credited with its invention.</p>

at all, but Bode himself puts it in the mouth of Lessing.</p>

published later, but with the same date. See <i>Allg. deutsche

There will be frequent occasion to mention this impulse emanating from

book “Freundschaften” (Leipzig, 1775) in which the author beholds a

years later, inserts for the same book, “Thousand and one Nights.” In
speaking of this, Böttiger calls “Pilgrim’s Progress” “die schale
engländische Robinsonade,” an eloquent proof of Böttiger’s ignorance of
English literature.</p>

CHAPTER IV</a><br>
&nbsp;<br>
STERNE IN GERMANY AFTER THE PUBLICATION<br>
OF THE SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY</h3>


<p>The publication of the Sentimental Journey, as implied in the
previous chapter, brought Sterne into vital connection with literary
impulses and emotional experiences in Germany, and his position as a
leader was at once recognized. Because of the immediate translations,
the reviews of the English original are markedly few, even in journals
which gave considerable attention to English literary affairs. The
<i>Neue Bibliothek der schönen Wissenschaften</i><a class = "tag" name =
"tagIV_1" id = "tagIV_1" href = "#noteIV_1">1</a> purposely delays a
full review of the book because of the promised translation, and
contents itself with the remark, “that we have not read for a long time
anything more full of sentiment and humor.” Yet, strangely enough, the
translation is never worthily treated, only the new edition of 1771 is
mentioned,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_2" id = "tagIV_2" href =
"#noteIV_2">2</a> with especial praise of Füger’s illustrations.</p>

<p>Other journals devote long reviews to the new favorite: according to
the <i>Jenaische Zeitungen von Gelehrten Sachen</i><a class = "tag" name
= "tagIV_3" id = "tagIV_3" href = "#noteIV_3">3</a> all the learned
periodicals vied with one another in lavish bestowal of praise upon
these Journeys. The journals consulted go far toward justifying this
statement.</p>

<p>The <i>Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek</i> reviews both the Bode and
Mittelstedt renderings, together with Bode’s translation of Stevenson’s
continuation, in the second volume of the Anhang to Volumes I-XII.<a

The critique of Bode’s work defines, largely in the words of the book
itself, the peculiar purpose and method of the Journey, and comments
briefly but with frank enthusiasm on the various touching incidents of
the narrative:

“Nur ein von der Natur verwahrloseter bleibt dabei kalt und
gleichgültig,” remarks the reviewer. The conception of Yorick’s personal
character, which prevailed in Germany, obtained by a process of
elimination and misunderstanding, is represented by this critic when he
records without modifying his statement: “Various times Yorick shows
himself as the most genuine foe of self-seeking, of immoral <i>double
entendre</i>, and particularly of assumed seriousness, and he scourges
them emphatically.” The review of the third and fourth parts contains a
similar and perhaps even more significant passage illustrating the view
of Yorick’s character held by those who did not know him and had the
privilege of admiring him only in his writings and at a safe distance.
“Yorick,” he says, “although he sometimes brings an event, so to speak,
to the brink of an indecorous issue, manages to turn it at once with the greatest
<ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘delicay’">delicacy</ins>
to a decorous termination. Or he leaves it
incomplete under such circumstances that the reader is impressed by the
rare delicacy of mind of the author, and can never suspect that such a
man, who never allows a <i>double entendre</i> to enter his mind without
a blush, has entertained an indecent idea.” This view is derived from a
somewhat short-sighted reading of the Sentimental Journey: the obvious
Sterne of Tristram Shandy, and the more insidiously concealed creator of
the Journey could hardly be characterized discriminatingly by such a
statement. Sterne’s cleverness consists not in suggesting his own
innocence of imagination, but in the skill with which he assures his
reader that he is master of the situation, and that no possible
interpretation of the passage has escaped his intelligence. To the
Mittelstedt translation is accorded in this review the distinction of
being, in the rendering of certain passages, more correct than Bode’s.
A&nbsp;reviewer in the <i>Hallische Neue Gelehrte Zeitung</i><a class =

of Greifswald gives a review of Bode’s rendering in which a parallel
with Shakespeare is suggested. The original mingling of instruction and
waggery is commented upon, imitation is discouraged, and the work is
held up as a test, through appreciation or failure to appreciate, of a
reader’s ability to follow another’s feelings, to understand far-away
hints and allusions, to follow the tracks of an irregular and errant
wit.</p>

<p>The <i>Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent</i> for October
29, 1768, regards the book in Bode’s translation as an individual,
unparalleled work of genius and discourses at length upon its beneficent
medicinal effects upon those whose minds and hearts are perplexed and
clouded. The wanton passages are acknowledged, but the reviewer asserts
that the author must be pardoned them for the sake of his generous and
kind-hearted thoughts. The Mittelstedt translation is also quoted and
parallel passages are adduced to demonstrate the superiority of Bode’s
translation.</p>

<p>The Germans naturally learned to know the continuation of Eugenius
chiefly through Bode’s translation, designated as the third and fourth
volumes of the work, and thus because of the sanction of the
intermediary, were led to regard Stevenson’s tasteless, tedious and
revolting narrative with a larger measure of favor than would presumably
have been accorded to the original, had it been circulated extensively
in Germany. After years the <i>Allgemeine Literatur Zeitung</i><a class
= "tag" name = "tagIV_7" id = "tagIV_7" href = "#noteIV_7">7</a> implies
incidentally that Bode’s esteeming this continuation worthy of his
attention is a fact to be taken into consideration in judging its
merits, and states that Bode beautified it. Bode’s additions and
alterations were, as has been pointed out, all directly along the line
of the Yorick whom the Germans had made for themselves. It is
interesting to observe that the reviewer of these two volumes of the
continuation in the <i>Neue Critische Nachrichten</i>,<a class = "tag"
name = "tagIV_8" id = "tagIV_8" href = "#noteIV_8">8</a> while
recognizing the inevitability of failure in such a bold attempt, and
acknowledging that the outward form of the work may by its similarity be
at first glance seductive, notes two passages of sentiment “worthy even
of a Yorick,”&mdash;the
<span class = "pagenum">58</span>
<a name = "page58" id = "page58"> </a>
episode “Das Hündchen” and the anecdote of the sparrows which the
traveler shot in the garden: both are additions on Bode’s part, and have
no connection with the original. The reviewer thus singled out for
especial approval two interpolations by the German translator, incidents
which in their conception and narration have not the true English Yorick
ring.</p>

<p>The success of the Sentimental Journey increased the interest in the
incomprehensible Shandy. Lange’s new edition of Zückert’s translation
has been noted, and before long Bode<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_9" id
= "tagIV_9" href = "#noteIV_9">9</a> was induced to undertake a German
rendering of the earlier and longer novel. This translation was finished
in the summer of 1774, the preface being dated “End of August.” The
foreword is mainly concerned with Goeze’s attack on Bode’s personal
character, a&nbsp;thrust founded on Bode’s connection with the
Sentimental Journey and its continuation. At the close of this
introduction Bode says that, without undervaluing the intelligence of
his readers, he had regarded notes as essential, but because of his
esteem for the text, and a parental affection for the notes, he has
foreborne to insert them here. “So they still lie in my desk, as many as
there are of them, but upon pressing hints they might be washed and
combed, and then be published under the title perhaps of a ‘Real und
Verballexicon über Tristram Shandy’s Leben und Meinungen.’” This hint of
a work of his own, serving as a commentary to Tristram Shandy, has been
the occasion of some discussion. A&nbsp;reviewer in the <i>Allgemeine
deutsche Bibliothek</i>,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_10" id =
"tagIV_10" href = "#noteIV_10">10</a> in an account of Bode’s and
Wichmann’s renderings of “Tom Jones,” begs Bode to fulfill the hopes
thus raised, saying he could give Yorick’s friends no more valuable or
treasured gift. Böttiger in his biographical sketch of Bode expressed
regret that the work never saw the light, adding that the work contained
so many allusions to contemporary celebrities and hits upon Bode’s
acquaintance that wisdom had consigned to oblivion.<a class = "tag" name
= "tagIV_11" id = "tagIV_11" href = "#noteIV_11">11</a>
A&nbsp;correspondent, writing to the <i>Teutscher Merkur</i>,<a class =
"tag" name = "tagIV_12" id = "tagIV_12" href = "#noteIV_12">12</a>
minimizes the importance of
<span class = "pagenum">59</span>
<a name = "page59" id = "page59"> </a>
this so-called commentary, saying “er hatte nie einen Kommentar der Art,
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. auch nur angefangen auszuarbeiten. Die ganze Sache
gründet sich auf eine scherzhafte Aeusserung gegen seinem damaligen
Freund in Hamburg, welchen er oft mit der ihm eignen Ironie mit diesem
Kommentar zu drohen pflegte.”</p>

<p>The list of subscribers to Bode’s translation contained upwards of
650 names, among which are Boie, Claudius, Einsieder, Gerstenberg,
Gleim, Fräulein von Göchhausen, Goethe, Hamann, Herder, Hippel, Jacobi,
Klopstock, Schummel, Wieland (five copies), and Zimmermann. The names of
Ebert and Lessing are not on the list. The number of subscribers in
Mitau (twelve) is worthy of note, as illustrating the interest in Sterne
still keenly alive in this small and far away town, undoubtedly a direct
result of the admiration so lavishly expressed in other years by Herder,
Hamann and their circle.</p>

<p>The translation was hailed then as a masterly achievement of an
arduous task, the difficulties of which are only the less appreciated
because of the very excellence of the performance. It contrasts most
strikingly with its clumsy predecessor in its approximation to Sterne’s
deftness of touch, his delicate turns of phrase, his seemingly obvious
and facile, but really delicate and accurate choice of expression.
Zückert was heavy, commonplace, uncompromisingly literal and bristling
with inaccuracies. Bode’s work was unfortunately not free from errors in
spite of its general excellence, yet it brought the book within reach of
those who were unable to read it in English, and preserved, in general
with fidelity, the spirit of the original. The reviews were prodigal of
praise. Wieland’s expressions of admiration were full-voiced and
extensive.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_13" id = "tagIV_13" href =
"#noteIV_13">13</a></p>

<p>The <i>Wandsbecker Bothe</i> for October 28, 1774, asserts that many
readers in England had not understood the book as well as Bode,
a&nbsp;frequent expression of inordinate commendation; that Bode follows
close on the heels of Yorick on his most intimate expeditions. The
<i>Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen</i><a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_14"
id = "tagIV_14" href = "#noteIV_14">14</a> copies in full the
translation of the first chapter as both
<span class = "pagenum">60</span>
<a name = "page60" id = "page60"> </a>
Zückert and Bode rendered it, and praises the latter in unqualified
terms; Bode appears as “Yorick’s rescuer.” Several years later, in the
<i>Deutsches Museum</i>, the well-known French translation of Shandy by
Frenais is denounced as intolerable (unerträglich) to a German who is
acquainted with Bode’s,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_15" id =
"tagIV_15" href = "#noteIV_15">15</a> an opinion emphasized later in the
same magazine<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_16" id = "tagIV_16" href =
"#noteIV_16">16</a> by Joseph von Retzer. Indeed, upon these two
translations from Sterne rests Bode’s reputation as a translator. His
“Tom Jones” was openly criticised as bearing too much of Sterne,<a class
= "tag" name = "tagIV_17" id = "tagIV_17" href = "#noteIV_17">17</a> so
great was the influence of Yorick upon the translator. Klamer Schmidt in
a poem called “Klamersruh, eine ländlich malerische Dichtung,”<a class =
"tag" name = "tagIV_18" id = "tagIV_18" href = "#noteIV_18">18</a>
dilating upon his favorite authors during a country winter, calls Bode
“our Sterne” and “the ideal translator,” and in some verses by the same
poet, quoted in the article on Bode in Schlichtegroll’s “Nekrolog,”<a
class = "tag" name = "tagIV_19" id = "tagIV_19" href =
"#noteIV_19">19</a> is found a very significant stanza expressing
Sterne’s immeasurable obligation to his German translator:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Er geht zu dir nun, unser Bode!</p>
<p>Empfang ihn, Yoriks Geist! Auch dein</p>
<p>Erbarmt er sich,</p>
<p>Errettete vom Tode</p>
<p>Der Uebersetzer dich!”</p>
</div>

<p>Matthison in his “Gruss aus der Heimath,”<a class = "tag" name =
"tagIV_20" id = "tagIV_20" href = "#noteIV_20">20</a> pays similar
tribute in a vision connected with a visit to Bode’s resting-place in
Weimar. It is a fanciful relation: as Bode’s shade is received with
jubilation and delight in the Elysian Fields by Cervantes, Rabelais,
Montaigne, Fielding and Sterne, the latter censures Bode for distrusting
his own creative power, indicating that he might have stood with the
group just enumerated, that the fame of being “the most excellent
transcriber” of his age should not have sufficed.</p>

<p>In view of all this marked esteem, it is rather surprising to
<span class = "pagenum">61</span>
<a name = "page61" id = "page61"> </a>
find a few years later a rather sweeping, if apologetic, attack on the
rendering of Shandy. J.&nbsp;L. Benzler, the librarian of Graf Stolberg
at Wernigerode, published in 1801 a translation of Shandy which bore the
legend “Newly translated into German,” but was really a new edition of
Bode’s work with various corrections and alterations.<a class = "tag"
name = "tagIV_21" id = "tagIV_21" href = "#noteIV_21">21</a> Benzler
claims in his preface that there had been no translation of the
masterpiece worthy of the original, and this was because the existing
translation was from the pen of Bode, in whom one had grown to see the
very ideal of a translator, and because praise had been so lavishly
bestowed on the work by the critics. He then asserts that Bode never
made a translation which did not teem with mistakes; he translated
incorrectly through insufficient knowledge of English, confusing words
which sound alike, made his author say precisely the opposite of what he
really did say, was often content with the first best at hand, with the
half-right, and often erred in taste;&mdash;a&nbsp;wholesale and
vigorous charge. After such a disparagement, Benzler disclaims all
intention to belittle Bode, or his service, but he condescendingly
ascribes Bode’s failure to his lowly origin, his lack of systematic
education, and of early association with the cultured world. Benzler
takes Bode’s work as a foundation and rewrites. Some of his changes are
distinctly advantageous, and that so few of these errors in Bode’s
translation were noted by contemporary critics is a proof of their
ignorance of the original, or their utter confidence in Bode.<a class =
"tag" name = "tagIV_22" id = "tagIV_22" href = "#noteIV_22">22</a>
Benzler in his preface of justification enumerates several extraordinary
blunders<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_23" id = "tagIV_23" href =
"#noteIV_23">23</a> and then concludes with a rather inconsistent
parting thrust at Bode, the perpetrator of such nonsense, at the critics
who could overlook such errors and praise the work inordinately, and at
the
<span class = "pagenum">62</span>
<a name = "page62" id = "page62"> </a>
public who ventured to speak with delight of the work, knowing it only
in such a rendering. Benzler was severely taken to task in the <i>Neue
Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek</i><a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_24" id
= "tagIV_24" href = "#noteIV_24">24</a> for his shamelessness in
rewriting Bode’s translation with such comparatively insignificant
alterations, for printing on the title page in brazen effrontery “newly
translated into German,” and for berating Bode for his failure after
cursing him with condescension. Passages are cited to demonstrate the
comparative triviality of Benzler’s work. A&nbsp;brief comparison of the
two translations shows that Benzler often translates more correctly than
his predecessor, but still more often makes meaningless alterations in
word-order, or in trifling words where nothing is to be gained by such a
change.</p>

<p>The same year Benzler issued a similar revision of the Sentimental
Journey,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_25" id = "tagIV_25" href =
"#noteIV_25">25</a> printing again on the title page “newly translated
into German.” The <i>Neue Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek</i><a class =
"tag" name = "tagIV_26" id = "tagIV_26" href = "#noteIV_26">26</a>
greets this attempt with a similar tart review, containing parallel
quotations as before, proving Benzler’s inconsiderate presumption. Here
Benzler had to face Bode’s assertion that both Lessing and Ebert had
assisted in the work, and that the former had in his kindness gone
through the whole book. Benzler treats this fact rather cavalierly and
renews his attack on Bode’s rendering. Benzler resented this review and
replied to it in a later number of the same periodical.<a class = "tag"
name = "tagIV_27" id = "tagIV_27" href = "#noteIV_27">27</a></p>

<p>Now that a century and more has elapsed, and personal acrimony can no
longer play any part in criticism, one may justly admit Benzler’s
service in calling attention to inaccurate and inadequate translation,
at the same time one must condemn utterly his manner of issuing his
emendations. In 1831 there appeared a translation of Tristram Shandy
which was again but a revision of Bode’s work. It bore on the title page
“Neu übertragen von W.&nbsp;H.,” and contained a sketch of Sterne’s
life.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_28" id = "tagIV_28" href =
"#noteIV_28">28</a></p>

<p>In the nineties there seemed to be a renewal of Yorick
<span class = "pagenum">63</span>
<a name = "page63" id = "page63"> </a>
enthusiasm, and at this time was brought forth, at Halle in 1794,
a&nbsp;profusely annotated edition of the Sentimental Journey,<a class =
"tag" name = "tagIV_29" id = "tagIV_29" href = "#noteIV_29">29</a> which
was, according to the anonymous editor, a&nbsp;book not to be read, but
to be studied. Claim is made that the real meaning of the book may be
discovered only after several careful readings, that “empfindsam” in
some measure was here used in the sense of philosophical, that the book
should be treated as a work of philosophy, though clad in pleasing garb;
that it should be thought out according to its merits, not merely read.
Yorick’s failure to supply his chapters with any significant or alluring
chapter-headings (probably the result of indolence on his part) is here
interpreted as extraordinary sagacity, for he thereby lessens the
expectations and heightens the effect. “Eine Empfindungs-reise” is
declared to be a more suitable name than “Empfindsame Reise,” and
comment is made upon the purpose of the Journey, the gathering of
material for anatomical study of the human heart. The notes are numerous
and lengthy, constituting a quarter to a third of the book, but are
replete with padding, pointless babble and occasional puerile
inaccuracies. They are largely attempts to explain and to moralize upon
Yorick’s emotions,&mdash;a&nbsp;verbose, childish, witless commentary.
The Wortregister contains fourteen pages in double columns of
explanations, in general differing very little from the kind of
information given in the notes. The <i>Allgemeine Litteratur
Zeitung</i><a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_30" id = "tagIV_30" href =
"#noteIV_30">30</a> devotes a long review chiefly to the explanation of
the errors in this volume, not the least striking of which is the
explanation of the reference to Smelfungus, whom everyone knows to have
been Smollett: “This learned Smelfungus appears to have written nothing but the Journey which is here
<ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘mentionad’">mentioned</ins>.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_31"
id = "tagIV_31" href = "#noteIV_31">31</a> As an explanation of the
initial “H” used by Sterne for Hume, the note is given, “The author ‘H’
was perhaps a poor one.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_32" id =
"tagIV_32" href = "#noteIV_32">32</a></p>

<p>Sterne’s letters were issued first in London in 1775, a&nbsp;rather
surprisingly long time after his death, when one considers how
<span class = "pagenum">64</span>
<a name = "page64" id = "page64"> </a>
great was Yorick’s following. According to the prefatory note of Lydia
Sterne de Medalle in the collection which she edited and published, it
was the wish of Mrs. Sterne that the correspondence of her husband,
which was in her possession, be not given to the world, unless other
letters bearing his name should be published. This hesitation on her
part must be interpreted in such a way as to cast a favorable light on
this much maligned gentlewoman, as a delicate reticence on her part,
a&nbsp;desire to retain these personal documents for herself.<a class =
"tag" name = "tagIV_33" id = "tagIV_33" href = "#noteIV_33">33</a> The
power of this sentiment must be measured by her refraining from
publishing during the five years which intervened between her husband’s
death and her own, March, 1768 to January, 1773&mdash;years which were
embittered by the distress of straitened circumstances. It will be
remembered that an effort was made by Mrs. Sterne and her daughter to
retrieve their fortunes by a life of Sterne which was to be a
collaboration by Stevenson and Wilkes, and urgent indeed was Lydia
Sterne’s appeal to these friends of her father to fulfill their promises
and lend their aid. Even when this hope had to be abandoned early in
1770, through the faithlessness of Sterne’s erstwhile companions, the
widow and daughter turned to other possibilities rather than to the
correspondence, though in the latter lay a more assured means of
accomplishing a temporary revival of their prosperity. This is an
evidence of fine feeling on the part of Sterne’s widow, with which she
has never been duly credited.</p>

<p>But an anonymous editor published early in 1775<a class = "tag" name
= "tagIV_34" id = "tagIV_34" href = "#noteIV_34">34</a> a&nbsp;volume
entitled “Letters from Yorick to Eliza,” a&nbsp;brief little collection,
the source of which has never been clear, but whose genuineness has
never been questioned. The editor himself waives all claim to proof
“which might be drawn concerning their authenticity from the character
of the gentleman who had the perusal of them, and with Eliza’s
permission, faithfully copied them at Bombay.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">65</span>
<a name = "page65" id = "page65"> </a>
<p>In July of this same year<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_35" id =
"tagIV_35" href = "#noteIV_35">35</a> was published a volume entitled
“Sterne’s Letters to His Friends on Various Occasions, to which is added
his History of a Watchcoat with Explanatory Notes,” containing twelve
letters (one by Dr. Eustace) and the watchcoat story. Some of these
letters had appeared previously in British magazines, and one, copied
from the <i>London Magazine</i>, was translated in the <i>Wandsbecker
Bothe</i> for April 16, 1774.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_36" id =
"tagIV_36" href = "#noteIV_36">36</a> A&nbsp;translation of the same
letter was given in the <i>Gothaische Gelehrte Zeitungen</i>, 1774, pp.
286&ndash;7. Three of these letters only are accepted by Prof.
Saintsbury (Nos.&nbsp;7, 124, the letter of Dr. Eustace, and 125). Of
the others, Nos.&nbsp;4&ndash;11 have been judged as of doubtful
authenticity. Two of them, Nos. 11 and 12 (“I beheld her tender look”
and “I&nbsp;feel the weight of obligation”) are in the standard
ten-volume edition of Sterne,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_37" id =
"tagIV_37" href = "#noteIV_37">37</a> but the last letter is probably
spurious also.</p>

<p>The publication of the letters from Yorick to Eliza was the
justification afforded Lydia Sterne de Medalle for issuing her father’s
correspondence according to her mother’s request: the other volume was
not issued till after it was known that Sterne’s daughter was engaged in
the task of collecting and editing his correspondence. Indeed, the
editor expressly states in his preface that it is not the purpose of the
book to forestall Mme. Medalle’s promised collection; that the letters
in this volume are not to be printed in hers.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagIV_38" id = "tagIV_38" href = "#noteIV_38">38</a> Mme. Medalle added
to her collection the “Fragment in the manner of Rabelais” and the
invaluable, characteristic scrap of autobiography, which was written
particularly for “my Lydia.” The work
<span class = "pagenum">66</span>
<a name = "page66" id = "page66"> </a>
appeared at Becket’s in three volumes, and the dedication to Garrick was
dated June, 1775; but, as the notice in the <i>Monthly Review</i> for
October<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_39" id = "tagIV_39" href =
"#noteIV_39">39</a> asserts that they have “been published but a few
days,” this date probably represents the time of the completion of the
task, or the inception of the printer’s work.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagIV_40" id = "tagIV_40" href = "#noteIV_40">40</a> During the same
year the spurious letters from Eliza to Yorick were issued.</p>

<p>Naturally Sterne’s letters found readers in Germany, the Yorick-Eliza
correspondence being especially calculated to awaken response.<a class =
"tag" name = "tagIV_41" id = "tagIV_41" href = "#noteIV_41">41</a> The
English edition of the “Letters from Yorick to Eliza” was reviewed in
the <i>Neue Bibliothek der schönen Wissenschaften</i>,<a class = "tag"
name = "tagIV_42" id = "tagIV_42" href = "#noteIV_42">42</a> with a hint
that the warmth of the letters might easily lead to a suspicion of
unseemly relationship, but the reviewer contends that virtue and
rectitude are preserved in the midst of such extraordinary tenderness,
so that one may interpret it as a Platonic rather than a sensual
affection. Yet this review cannot be designated as distinctive of German
opinion, for it contains no opinion not directly to be derived from the
editor’s foreword, and that alone; indeed, the wording suggests
decidedly that source. The <i>Gothaische Gelehrte Zeitung</i><a class =
"tag" name = "tagIV_43" id = "tagIV_43" href = "#noteIV_43">43</a> for
April 15, 1775, reviews the same English edition, but the notice
consists of an introductory statement of Eliza’s identity and
translation of parts of three letters, the “Lord Bathurst letter,” the
letter involving the criticism of Eliza’s portraits,<a class = "tag"
name = "tagIV_44" id = "tagIV_44" href = "#noteIV_44">44</a> and the
last letter to Eliza. The translation is very weak, abounding in
elementary errors; for example, “She has got your picture and likes it”
becomes “Sie hat Ihr Bildniss gemacht, es ist ähnlich,” and
“I&nbsp;beheld you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as a very plain woman” is rendered
“und hielt Sie für nichts anders
<span class = "pagenum">67</span>
<a name = "page67" id = "page67"> </a>
als eine Frau.” The same journal,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_45" id =
"tagIV_45" href = "#noteIV_45">45</a> August 5, reviews the second
collection of Sterne’s letters, but there is no criticism, merely an
introductory statement taken from the preface, and the translation of
two letters, the one to Mistress V., “Of two bad cassocs, fair lady,”
and the epistle beginning, “I&nbsp;snatch half an hour while my dinner
is getting ready.” The <i>Göttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen</i>, 1776,
p.&nbsp;382, also gives in a review information concerning this
anonymous collection, but no criticism.</p>

<p>One would naturally look to Hamburg for translations of these
epistles. In the very year of their appearance in England we find
“Yorick’s Briefe an Eliza,” Hamburg, bey C.&nbsp;E. Bohn, 1775;<a class
= "tag" name = "tagIV_46" id = "tagIV_46" href = "#noteIV_46">46</a>
“Briefe von Eliza an Yorick,” Hamburg, bey Bode, 1775; and “Briefe von
(Yorick) Sterne an seine Freunde nebst seiner Geschichte eines
Ueberrocks,” Hamburg, bey Bohn, 1775. The translator’s name is not
given, but there is every reason to suppose that it was the faithful
Bode, though only the first volume is mentioned in Jördens’ account of
him, and under his name in Goedeke’s “Grundriss.” Contemporary reviewers
attributed all three books to Bode, and internal evidence goes to prove
it.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_47" id = "tagIV_47" href =
"#noteIV_47">47</a></p>

<p>The first volume contains no translator’s preface, and the second,
the spurious Eliza letters, only a brief footnote to the translation of
the English preface. In this note Bode’s identity is evident in the
following quotation: He says he has translated the letters “because I
believe that they will be read with pleasure, and because I fancy I have
a kind of vocation to give in German everything that Sterne has written,
or whatever has immediate relation to his writings.” This note is dated
Hamburg, September 16, 1775. In the third volume, the miscellaneous
collection, there is a translator’s preface in which again Bode’s hand
is evident. He says he knows by sure experience that Sterne’s writings
find readers in Germany; he is assured of the authenticity of the
letters, but is in doubt whether the reader is possessed of sufficient
knowledge of the
<span class = "pagenum">68</span>
<a name = "page68" id = "page68"> </a>
attending circumstances to render intelligible the allusion of the
watchcoat story. To forfend the possibility of such dubious
appreciation, the account of the watchcoat episode is copied word for
word from Bode’s introduction to the “Empfindsame Reise.”<a class =
"tag" name = "tagIV_48" id = "tagIV_48" href = "#noteIV_48">48</a></p>

<p>In this same year, an unknown translator issued in a single volume a
rendering of these three collections.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_49"
id = "tagIV_49" href = "#noteIV_49">49</a> The following year Mme.
Medalle’s collection was brought out in Leipzig in an anonymous
translation, which has been attributed to Christian Felix Weisse.<a
class = "tag" name = "tagIV_50" id = "tagIV_50" href =
"#noteIV_50">50</a> Its title was “Lorenz Sterne’s Briefe an seine
vertrautesten Freunde nebst einem Fragment im Geschmack des Rabelais und
einer von ihm selbst verfassten Nachricht von seinem Leben und seiner
Familie, herausgegeben von seiner Tochter Mad. Medalle,” Leipzig, 1776,
pp. xxviii, 391. Weidmanns Erben und Reich.</p>

<p>Bode’s translation of Yorick’s letters to Eliza is reviewed in the
<i>Gothaische Gelehrte Zeitung</i>, August 9, 1775, with quotation of
the second letter in full. The same journal notes the translation of the
miscellaneous collection, November 4, 1775, giving in full the letter of
Dr. Eustace and Sterne’s reply.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_51" id =
"tagIV_51" href = "#noteIV_51">51</a> The <i>Allgemeine deutsche
Bibliothek</i><a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_52" id = "tagIV_52" href =
"#noteIV_52">52</a> reviews together the three Hamburg volumes (Bode)
and the Leipzig volume containing the same letters. The utter innocence,
the unquestionably Platonic character of the relations between Yorick
and Eliza is accepted fully. With keen, critical judgment the reviewer
is inclined to doubt the originality of the Eliza letters. Two letters
by Yorick are mentioned particularly, letters which bear testimony to
Yorick’s practical benevolence: one describing his efforts in behalf of
a dishonored maiden, and one concerning the old man who fell into
financial difficulties.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_53" id =

win approval, but Bode’s is preferred; they are designated as doubtless
his. The “Briefe an Elisa” (Bode’s translation) are noticed in the
<i>Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen</i>, October 3 and 6, 1775, with
unrestrained praise of the translator, and vigorous asseveration of
their authenticity. It is recognized fully that the relation as
disclosed was extraordinary among married people, even Sterne’s amazing
statement concerning the fragile obstacles which stood in the way of
their desires is noted. Yet the Yorick of these letters is accorded
undisguised admiration. His love is exalted above that of Swift for
Stella, Waller for Sacharissa, Scarron for Maintenon,<a class = "tag"
name = "tagIV_54" id = "tagIV_54" href = "#noteIV_54">54</a> and his
godly fear as here exhibited is cited to offset the outspoken avowal of
dishonoring desire.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_55" id = "tagIV_55"

<p>In 1787 another volume of Sterne letters was issued in London, giving
English and German on opposite pages.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_57"
id = "tagIV_57" href = "#noteIV_57">57</a> There are but six letters and

<p>In 1780 there was published a volume of confessedly spurious letters
entitled “Briefe von Yorick und Elisen, wie sie zwischen ihnen konnten
geschrieben werden.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_58" id = "tagIV_58"
href = "#noteIV_58">58</a> The introduction contains some interesting
information for the determination of the genuineness of the Sterne
letters.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_59" id = "tagIV_59" href =
"#noteIV_59">59</a> The editor states that the author had written these
letters purely as a diversion, that the editor had proposed their
publication, but was always met with refusal until there appeared in
London a little volume of letters which their editor emphatically
declared to be genuine. This is evidently the volume published by the
anonymous editor in 1775, and our present editor declares that
<span class = "pagenum">70</span>
<a name = "page70" id = "page70"> </a>
he knows Nos.&nbsp;4&ndash;10 were from the same pen as the present
confessedly spurious collection. They were mere efforts originally, but,
published in provincial papers, found their way into other journals, and
the editor goes on to say, that, to his astonishment, he saw one of
these epistles included in Lydia Medalle’s collection. This is, of
course, No.&nbsp;5, the one beginning, “The first time I have dipped my
pen in the ink-horn.” These events induced the author to allow the
publication. The book itself consists mostly of a kind of diary kept by
Yorick to send to Eliza at Madeira and later to India, and a
corresponding journal written by Eliza on the vessel and at Madeira.</p>

<p>Yorick’s sermons were inevitably less potent in their appeal, and the
editions and translations were less numerous. In spite of obvious
effort, Sterne was unable to infuse into his homiletical discourses any
considerable measure of genuine Shandeism, and his sermons were never as
widely popular as his two novels, either among those who sought him for
whimsical pastime or for sentimental emotion. They were sermons. The
early Swiss translation has been duly noted.</p>

<p>The third volume of the Zürich edition, which appeared in 1769,
contained the “Reden an Esel,” which the reviewer in the <i>Allgemeine
deutsche Bibliothek</i><a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_60" id =
"tagIV_60" href = "#noteIV_60">60</a> with acute penetration designates
as spurious. Another translation of these sermons was published at
Leipzig, according to the editor of a later edition<a class = "tag" name
= "tagIV_61" id = "tagIV_61" href = "#noteIV_61">61</a> (Thorn, 1795),
in the same year as the Zürich issue, 1769.</p>

<p>The <i>Berlinische Monatsschrift</i><a class = "tag" name =
"tagIV_62" id = "tagIV_62" href = "#noteIV_62">62</a> calls attention to
the excellence of the work and quotes the sermons at considerable
length. The comment contains the erroneous statement that Sterne was a
dissenter, and opposed to the established church. The translation
published at Thorn in 1795, evidently building on this information,
continues the error, and, in explanation of English church affairs, adds
as enlightenment the thirty-nine articles. This translation is
confessedly a working-over of the Leipzig translation already mentioned.
It is difficult to discover
<span class = "pagenum">71</span>
<a name = "page71" id = "page71"> </a>
how these sermons ever became attached to Sterne’s name, and one can
hardly explain the fact that such a magazine as the <i>Berlinische
Monatsschrift</i><a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_63" id = "tagIV_63" href
= "#noteIV_63">63</a> should at that late date publish an article so
flatly contradictory to everything for which Sterne stood, so
diametrically opposed to his career, save with the understanding that
gross ignorance attended the original introduction and early imitation
of Yorick, and that this incomprehension, or one-sided appreciation of
the real Sterne persisted in succeeding decades. The German Yorick was
the champion of the oppressed and downtrodden. The author of the
“Sermons to Asses” appeared as such an opponent of coercion and
arbitrary power in church and state, an upholder of human rights; hence,
possibly, the authorship of this book was attributed to Sterne by
something the same process as that which, in the age of heroic deeds,
associated a miscellaneous collection of performances with a popular
hero. The “Sermons to Asses” were written by Rev. James Murray
(1732&ndash;1782), a&nbsp;noted dissenting minister, long pastor of High
Bridge Chapel in Newcastle-on-Tyne. They were published in London in
1768 and dedicated to G.&nbsp;W., J.&nbsp;W., W.&nbsp;R. and
M.&nbsp;M.&mdash;George Whitfield, John Wesley, William Romaine and
Martin Madan. The English people are represented as burden-bearing asses
laden with oppression in the shape of taxes and creeds.<a class = "tag"
name = "tagIV_64" id = "tagIV_64" href = "#noteIV_64">64</a> They are
directed against the power of the established church. It is needless to
state that England never associated these sermons with Sterne.<a class =
"tag" name = "tagIV_65" id = "tagIV_65" href = "#noteIV_65">65</a> The
English edition was also briefly reviewed in the <i>Hamburgische
Adress-Comptoir-Nachrichten</i><a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_66" id =
"tagIV_66" href = "#noteIV_66">66</a> without connecting the work with
Sterne.
<span class = "pagenum">72</span>

The error was made later, possibly by the translator of the Zürich
edition.</p>

<p>The new collection of Sterne’s sermons published by Cadell in 1769,
Vols. V, VI, VII, is reviewed by <i>Unterhaltungen</i>.<a class = "tag"
name = "tagIV_67" id = "tagIV_67" href = "#noteIV_67">67</a>
A&nbsp;selection from Sterne’s sermon on the Prodigal Son was published
in translation in the <i>Hamburgische Adress-Comptoir-Nachrichten</i>
for April 13, 1768. The new collection of sermons was translated by
A.&nbsp;E. Klausing and published at Leipzig in 1770, containing
eighteen sermons.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_68" id = "tagIV_68" href
= "#noteIV_68">68</a></p>

<p>Both during Sterne’s life and after his death books were published
claiming him as their author. In England contemporary criticism
generally stigmatized these impertinent attempts as dubious, or
undoubtedly fraudulent. The spurious ninth volume of Shandy has been
mentioned.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_69" id = "tagIV_69" href =
"#noteIV_69">69</a> The “Sermons to Asses” just mentioned also belong
here, and, with reservation, also Stevenson’s continuation of the
Sentimental Journey, with its claim to recognition through the
continuator’s statement of his relation to Yorick. There remain also a
few other books which need to be mentioned because they were translated
into German and played their part there in shaping the German idea of
Yorick. In general, it may be said that German criticism was never acute
in judging these products, partially perhaps because they were viewed
through the medium of an imperfectly mastered foreign tongue,
a&nbsp;mediocre or an adapted translation. These books obtained
relatively a much more extensive recognition in Germany than in
England.</p>

<p>In 1769 a curious conglomerate was brought over and issued under the
lengthy descriptive title: “Yoricks Betrachtungen über verschiedene
wichtige und angenehme Gegenstände. Nemlich über Nichts, Ueber Etwas,
Ueber das Ding, Ueber die Regierung, Ueber den Toback, Ueber die Nasen,
Ueber die Quaksalber, Ueber die Hebammen, Ueber den Homunculus, Ueber
die Steckenpferde, Ueber das Momusglas, Ueber die Ausschweifungen, Ueber
die Dunkelkeit im Schreiben, Ueber
<span class = "pagenum">73</span>
<a name = "page73" id = "page73"> </a>
den Unsinn, Ueber die Verbindung der Ideen, Ueber die Hahnreiter, Ueber
den Mann in dem Monde, Ueber Leibnitzens Monaden, Ueber das was man
Vertu nennt, Ueber das Gewissen, Ueber die Trunkenheit, Ueber den
Nachtstuhl, Betrachtungen über Betrachtungen.&mdash;neque&mdash;cum
lectulus, aut me Porticus excepit, desum mihi, Horat.” Frankfurt und
Leipzig, 1769,&nbsp;8<sup>o</sup>. The book purported to be a collection
of Sterne’s earliest lucubrations, and the translator expresses his
astonishment that no one had ever translated them before, although they
were first issued in 1760. It is without doubt the translation of an
English volume entitled “Yorick’s Meditations upon interesting and
important subjects,” published by Stevens in London, 1760.<a class =
"tag" name = "tagIV_70" id = "tagIV_70" href = "#noteIV_70">70</a> It
had been forgotten in England long before some German chanced upon it.
The preface closes with a long doggerel rhyme, which, the translator
says, he has purposely left untranslated. It is, however, beyond the
shadow of a doubt original with him, as its contents prove. Yorick in
the Elysian Fields is supposed to address himself, he “anticipates his
fate and perceives beforehand that at least one German critic would deem
him worthy of his applause.”</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Go on, poor Yorik, try once more</p>
<p>In German Dress, thy fate of yore,</p>
<p>Expect few Critics, such, as by</p>
<p>The bucket of Philosophy</p>
<p>From out the bottom of the well</p>
<p>May draw the Sense of what you tell</p>
<p>And spy what wit and Morals sound</p>
<p>Are in thy Rambles to be found.”</p>
</div>

<p>After a passage in which the rhymester enlarges upon the probability
of distorted judgment, he closes with these lines:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Dire Fate! but for all that no worse,</p>
<p>You shall be WIELAND’S Hobby-Horse,</p>
<p>So to HIS candid Name, unbrib’d</p>
<p>These meditations be inscrib’d.”</p>
</div>

<p>This was at the time of Wieland’s early enthusiasm, when he was
probably contemplating, if not actually engaged upon a translation of
Tristram Shandy. “Thy fate of yore” in the
<span class = "pagenum">74</span>
<a name = "page74" id = "page74"> </a>
second line is evidently a poetaster’s acceptation of an obvious rhyme
and does not set Yorick’s German experience appreciably into the past.
The translator supplies frequent footnotes explaining the allusions to
things specifically English. He makes occasional comparison with German
conditions, always with the claim that Germany is better off, and needs
no such satire. The <i>Hallische Neue Gelehrte Zeitungen</i> for June 1,
1769, devotes a review of considerable length to this translation; in it
the reviewer asserts that one would have recognized the father of this
creation even if Yorick’s name had not stood on its forehead; that it
closely resembles its fellows even if one must place it a degree below
the Journey. The <i>Allgemeine Deutsche Bibliothek</i><a class = "tag"
name = "tagIV_71" id = "tagIV_71" href = "#noteIV_71">71</a> throws no
direct suspicion on the authenticity, but with customary insight and
sanity of criticism finds in this early work “a&nbsp;great deal that is
insipid and affected.” The <i>Deutsche Bibliothek der schönen
Wissenschaften</i>, however, in a review which shows a keen appreciation
of Sterne’s style, openly avows an inclination to question the
authenticity, save for the express statement of the translator; the
latter it agrees to trust.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_72" id =
"tagIV_72" href = "#noteIV_72">72</a> The book is placed far below the
Sentimental Journey, below Shandy also, but far above the artificial
tone of many other writers then popular. This relative ordering of
Sterne’s works is characteristic of German criticism. In the latter part
of the review its author seizes on a mannerism, the exaggerated use of
which emphatically sunders the book from the genuine Sterne, the
monotonous repetition of the critic’s protests and Yorick’s verbal
conflicts with them. Sterne himself used this device frequently, but
guardedly, and in ever-changing variety. Its careless use betrays the
mediocre imitator.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_73" id = "tagIV_73"
href = "#noteIV_73">73</a></p>

<p>The more famous Koran was also brought to German territory and
enjoyed there a recognition entirely beyond that accorded it in England.
This book was first given to the world in London as the “Posthumous
Works of a late celebrated
<span class = "pagenum">75</span>
<a name = "page75" id = "page75"> </a>
Genius deceased;”<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_74" id = "tagIV_74" href
= "#noteIV_74">74</a> a&nbsp;work in three parts, bearing the further
title, “The Koran, or the Life, Character and Sentiments of Tria Juncta
in Uno, M.&nbsp;N.&nbsp;A., Master of No Arts.” Richard Griffith was
probably the real author, but it was included in the first collected
edition of Sterne’s works, published in Dublin, 1779.<a class = "tag"
name = "tagIV_75" id = "tagIV_75" href = "#noteIV_75">75</a> The work
purports to be, in part, an autobiography of Sterne, in which the late
writer lays bare the secrets of his life, his early debauchery, his
father’s unworthiness, his profligate uncle, the ecclesiastic, and the
beginning of his literary career by advertising for hack work in London,
being in all a confused mass of impossible detail, loose notes and
disconnected opinion, which contemporary English reviews stigmatize as
manifestly spurious, “an infamous attempt to palm the united effusions
of dullness and indecency upon the world as the genuine production of
the late Mr. Sterne.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_76" id = "tagIV_76"
href = "#noteIV_76">76</a></p>

<p>In France the book was accepted as genuine and it was translated
(1853) by Alfred Hédouin as an authentic work of Sterne. In Germany,
too, it seems to have been recognized with little questioning as to its
genuineness; even in recent years Robert Springer, in an article
treating of Goethe’s relation to the Koran, quite openly contends for
its authenticity.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_77" id = "tagIV_77" href
= "#noteIV_77">77</a></p>

<span class = "pagenum">76</span>
<a name = "page76" id = "page76"> </a>
<p>Since a German translation appeared in the following year (1771), the
German reviews do not, in the main, concern themselves with the English
original. The <i>Neues Bremisches Magazin</i>,<a class = "tag" name =
"tagIV_78" id = "tagIV_78" href = "#noteIV_78">78</a> however, censures
the book quite severely, but the <i>Neue Bibliothek der schönen
Wissenschaften</i><a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_79" id = "tagIV_79"
href = "#noteIV_79">79</a> welcomes it with unquestioning praise. The
German rendering was by Johann Gottfried Gellius, and the title was
“Yorick’s Nachgelassene Werke.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_80" id =
"tagIV_80" href = "#noteIV_80">80</a> The <i>Deutsche Bibliothek der
schönen Wissenschaften</i><a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_81" id =
"tagIV_81" href = "#noteIV_81">81</a> does acknowledge the doubtful
authorship but accepts completely its Yorick tone and whim&mdash;“one
cannot tell the copyist from the original.” Various characteristics are
cited as common to this work and Yorick’s other writings, the contrast,
change, confusion, conflict with the critics and the talk about himself.
For the collection of aphorisms, sayings, fragments and maxims which
form the second part of the Koran, including the “Memorabilia,” the
reviewer suggests the name “Sterniana.” The reviewer acknowledges the
occasional failure in attempted thrusts of wit, the ineffective satire,
the immoral innuendo in some passages, but after the first word of doubt
the review passes on into a tone of seemingly complete acceptation.</p>

<p>In 1778 another translation of this book appeared, which has been
ascribed to Bode, though not given by Goedeke, Jördens or Meusel. Its
title was “Der Koran, oder Leben und Meynungen des Tria Juncta in
Uno.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_82" id = "tagIV_82" href =
"#noteIV_82">82</a> The <i>Almanach der deutschen Musen</i><a class =
"tag" name = "tagIV_83" id = "tagIV_83" href = "#noteIV_83">83</a>
treats this work with full measure of praise. The <i>Allgemeine deutsche
Bibliothek</i><a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_84" id = "tagIV_84" href =
"#noteIV_84">84</a> accepts the book in this translation as a genuine
product of Sterne’s genius. Sammer reprinted the “Koran” (Vienna, 1795,
12<sup>o</sup>) and included it in
<span class = "pagenum">77</span>
<a name = "page77" id = "page77"> </a>
his nine volume edition of Sterne’s complete works (Vienna, 1798).</p>

<p>Goethe’s connection with the “Koran,” which forms the most
interesting phase of its German career, will be treated later.</p>

<p>Sterne’s unacknowledged borrowings, his high-handed and extensive
appropriation of work not his own, were noted in Germany, the natural
result of Ferriar’s investigations in England, but they seem never to
have attracted any considerable attention or aroused any serious concern
among Sterne’s admirers so as to imperil his position: the question in
England attached itself as an ungrateful but unavoidable concomitant of
every discussion of Sterne and every attempt to determine his place in
letters. Böttiger tells us that Lessing possessed a copy of Burton’s
“Anatomy of Melancholy,” from which Sterne filched so much wisdom, and
that Lessing had marked in it several of the passages which Ferriar
later advanced as proof of Sterne’s theft. It seems that Bode purchased
this volume at Lessing’s auction in Hamburg. Lessing evidently thought
it not worth while to mention these discoveries, as he is entirely
silent on the subject. Böttiger is, in his account, most unwarrantedly
severe on Ferriar, whom he calls “the bilious Englishman” who attacked
Sterne “with so much bitterness.” This is very far from a veracious
conception of Ferriar’s attitude.</p>

<p>The comparative indifference in Germany to this phase of Sterne’s
literary career may well be attributed to the medium by which Ferriar’s
findings were communicated to cultured Germany. The book itself, or the
original Manchester society papers, seem never to have been reprinted or
translated, and Germany learned their contents through a <i>résumé</i>
written by Friedrich Nicolai and published in the <i>Berlinische
Monatsschrift</i> for February, 1795, which gives a very sane view of
the subject, one in the main distinctly favorable to Sterne. Nicolai
says Sterne is called with justice “One of the most refined, ingenious
and humorous authors of our time.” He asserts with capable judgment that
Sterne’s use of the borrowed passages, the additions and alterations,
the individual tone which he manages to infuse into them, all preclude
Sterne from being
<span class = "pagenum">78</span>
<a name = "page78" id = "page78"> </a>
set down as a brainless copyist. Nicolai’s attitude may be best
illustrated by the following passages:</p>

<p>“Germany has authors enough who resemble Sterne in lack of learning.
Would that they had a hundredth part of the merits by which he made up
for this lack, or rather which resulted from it.” “We would gladly allow
our writers to take their material from old books, and even many
expressions and turns of style, and indeed whole passages, even if like
Sterne .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they claimed it all as their own: only
they must be successful adapters; they must add from their own store of
observation and thought and feeling. The creator of Tristram Shandy does
this in rich measure.”</p>

<p>Nicolai also contends that Sterne was gifted with two characteristic
qualities which were not imitation,&mdash;his “Empfindsamkeit” and
“Laune”&mdash;and that by the former his works breathe a tender,
delicate beneficence, a&nbsp;character of noble humanity, while by the
latter a spirit of fairest mirth is spread over his pages, so that one
may never open them without a pleasant smile. “The investigation of
sources,” he says, “serves as explanation and does not mean depreciation
of an otherwise estimable author.”</p>

<p>By this article Nicolai choked the malicious criticism of the late
favorite which might have followed from some sources, had another
communicated the facts of Sterne’s thievery. Lichtenberg in the
“Göttingischer Taschenkalender,” 1796, that is, after the publication of
Nicolai’s article, but with reference to Ferriar’s essay in the
Manchester Memoirs, Vol. IV, under the title of “Gelehrte Diebstähle”
does impugn Sterne rather spitefully without any acknowledgment of his
extraordinary and extenuating use of his borrowings. “Yorick,” he says,
“once plucked a nettle which had grown upon Lorenzo’s grave; that was no
labor for him. Who will uproot this plant which Ferriar has set on his?”
Ferriar’s book was reviewed by the <i>Neue Bibliothek der schönen
Wissenschaften</i>, LXII, p.&nbsp;310.</p>

<p>Some of the English imitations of Sterne, which did not actually
claim him as author, also found their way to Germany, and there by a
less discriminating public were joined in a general
<span class = "pagenum">79</span>
<a name = "page79" id = "page79"> </a>
way to the mass of Yorick production, and the might of Yorick influence.
These works represent almost exclusively the Sterne of the Sentimental
Journey; for the shoal of petty imitations, explanations and protests
which appeared in England when Shandy was first issued<a class = "tag"
name = "tagIV_85" id = "tagIV_85" href = "#noteIV_85">85</a> had gone
their own petty way to oblivion before Germany awakened to Sterne’s
influence.</p>

<p>One of the best known of the English Sentimental Journeys was the
work of Samuel Paterson, entitled, “Another Traveller: or Cursory
Remarks and Critical Observations made upon a Journey through Part of
the Netherlands,&mdash;by Coriat Junior,” London, 1768, two volumes. The
author protested in a pamphlet published a little later that his work
was not an imitation of Sterne, that it was in the press before Yorick’s
book appeared; but a reviewer<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_86" id =
"tagIV_86" href = "#noteIV_86">86</a> calls his attention to the
sentimental journeying already published in Shandy. This work was
translated into German as “Empfindsame Reisen durch einen Theil der
Niederlande,” Bützow, 1774&ndash;1775,&nbsp;2 Parts,&nbsp;8<sup>o</sup>.
The translator was Karl Friedrich Müchler, who showed his bent in the
direction of wit and whim by the publication of several collections of
humorous anecdotes, witty ideas and satirical skits.<a class = "tag"
name = "tagIV_87" id = "tagIV_87" href = "#noteIV_87">87</a></p>

<p>Much later a similar product was published, entitled “Launige
<span class = "pagenum">80</span>
<a name = "page80" id = "page80"> </a>
Reise durch Holland in Yoricks<a class = "tag" href = "#noteIV_88"><ins

Manier, mit Charakterskizzen und Anekdoten über
die Sitten und Gebräuche der Holländer aus dem Englischen,” two volumes,
Zittau und Leipzig, 1795. The translation was by Reichel in Zittau.<a
class = "tag" name = "tagIV_88" id = "tagIV_88" href =
"#noteIV_88">88</a> This may possibly be Ireland’s “A&nbsp;Picturesque
Tour through Holland, Brabant and part of France, made in 1789,” two
volumes, London, 1790.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_89" id = "tagIV_89"
href = "#noteIV_89">89</a> The well-known “Peter Pennyless” was
reproduced as “Empfindsame Gedanken bey verschiedenen Vorfällen von
Peter Pennyless,” Leipzig, Weidmann, 1770.</p>

<p>In 1788 there appeared in England a continuation of the Sentimental
Journey<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_90" id = "tagIV_90" href =
"#noteIV_90">90</a> in which, to judge from the reviewers, the petty
author outdid Sterne in eccentricities of typography, breaks, dashes,
scantily filled and blank pages. This is evidently the original of “Die
neue empfindsame Reise in Yoriks Geschmack,” Leipzig,
1789,&nbsp;8<sup>o</sup>, pp. 168, which, according to the <i>Allgemeine
Litteratur-Zeitung</i> bristles with such extravagances.<a class = "tag"
name = "tagIV_91" id = "tagIV_91" href = "#noteIV_91">91</a></p>

<p>A much more successful attempt was the “Sentimental Journey, Intended
as a Sequel to Mr. Sterne’s, Through Italy, Switzerland and France, by
Mr. Shandy,” two volumes, 12<sup>o</sup>, 1793. This was evidently the
original of Schink’s work;<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_92" id =
"tagIV_92" href = "#noteIV_92">92</a> “Empfindsame Reisen durch Italien,
die Schweiz und Frankreich, ein Nachtrag zu den Yorikschen. Aus und nach
dem Englischen,” Hamburg, Hoffmann, 1794, pp. 272,&nbsp;8<sup>o</sup>.
The translator’s preface, which is dated Hamburg, March 1794, explains
his attitude toward the work as suggested in the expression “Aus und
nach dem Englischen,” that is, “aus, so lange wie Treue für den Leser
Gewinn schien und nach, wenn Abweichung für die deutsche Darstellung
notwendig war.” He claims to have softened the glaring colors of the
original and to have discarded, or altered the obscene pictures. The
author, as
<span class = "pagenum">81</span>
<a name = "page81" id = "page81"> </a>
described in the preface, is an illegitimate son of Yorick, named
Shandy, who writes the narrative as his father would have written it, if
he had lived. This assumed authorship proves quite satisfactorily its
connection with the English original, as there, too, in the preface, the
narrator is designated as a base-born son of Yorick. The book is, as a
whole, a&nbsp;fairly successful imitation of Yorick’s manner, and it
must be judged as decidedly superior to Stevenson’s attempt. The author
takes up the story where Sterne left it, in the tavern room with the
Piedmontese lady; and the narrative which follows is replete with
allusions to familiar episodes and sentiments in the real Journey, with
sentimental adventures and opportunities for kindly deeds, and
sympathetic tears; motifs used originally are introduced here,
a&nbsp;begging priest with a snuff-box, a&nbsp;confusion with the Yorick
in Hamlet, a&nbsp;poor girl with wandering mind seated by the wayside,
and others equally familiar.</p>

<p>It is not possible to determine the extent of Schink’s alterations to
suit German taste, but one could easily believe that the somewhat
lengthy descriptions of external nature, quite foreign to Sterne, were
original with him, and that the episode of the young German lady by the
lake of Geneva, with her fevered admiration for Yorick, and the
compliments to the German nation and the praise for great Germans,
Luther, Leibnitz and Frederick the Great, are to be ascribed to the same

suppose from his preface.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_93" id =
"tagIV_93" href = "#noteIV_93">93</a> Previous to the publication of the
whole translation, Schink published in the February number of the
<i>Deutsche Monatsschrift</i><a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_94" id =
"tagIV_94" href = "#noteIV_94">94</a> two sections of his book, “Die
<ins class = "correction" title = "superfluous “">Schöne</ins>
Obstverkäuferin” and “Elisa.” Later, in the May number, he published
three other fragments, “Turin, Hotel del Ponto,” “Die Verlegenheit,”
“Die Unterredung.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_95" id = "tagIV_95"
href = "#noteIV_95">95</a></p>

<p>A few years later Schink published another and very similar volume
with the title, “Launen, Phantasieen und Schilderungen
<span class = "pagenum">82</span>
<a name = "page82" id = "page82"> </a>
aus dem Tagebuche eines reisenden Engländers,”<a class = "tag" name =
"tagIV_96" id = "tagIV_96" href = "#noteIV_96">96</a> Arnstadt und
Rudolstadt, 1801, pp. 323. It has not been possible to find an English
original, but the translator makes claim upon one, though confessing
alterations to suit his German readers, and there is sufficient internal
evidence to point to a real English source. The traveler is a haggard,
pale-faced English clergyman, who, with his French servant, La Pierre,
has wandered in France and Italy and is now bound for Margate. Here
again we have sentimental episodes, one with a fair lady in a
post-chaise, another with a monk in a Trappist cloister, apostrophes to
the imagination, the sea, and nature, a&nbsp;new division of travelers,
a&nbsp;debate of personal attributes, constant appeals to his dear
Sophie, who is, like Eliza, ever in the background, occasional
references to objects made familiar through Yorick, as Dessein’s Hotel,
and a Yorick-like sympathy with the dumb beast; in short, an open
imitation of Sterne, but the motifs from Sterne are here more mixed and
less obvious. There is, as in the former book, much more enthusiasm for
nature than is characteristic of Sterne; and there is here much more
miscellaneous material, such, for example, as the tale of the two
sisters, which betrays no trace of Sterne’s influence. The latter part
of the volume is much less reminiscent of Yorick and suggests
interpolation by the translator.<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_97" id =

<p>Near the close of the century was published “Fragments in the manner
of Sterne,”&nbsp;8<sup>o</sup>, Debrett, 1797, which, according to the
<i>Monthly Review</i>,<a class = "tag" name = "tagIV_98" id = "tagIV_98"
href = "#noteIV_98">98</a> caught in large measure the sentimentality,
pathos and whimsicality of Sterne’s style. The British Museum catalogue
suggests J.&nbsp;Brandon as its author. This was reprinted by Nauck in
Leipzig in 1800, and a translation was given to the world by the same
publisher in the same year, with the added title: “Ein Seitenstück zu
Yoricks empfindsamen Reisen.” The translation is attributed by Kayser to

They are still credited to Sterne, though with admitted doubt, in
Hirsching (1809). It would seem from a letter of Hamann’s that Germany
also thrust another work upon Sterne. The letter is directed to Herder:
“Ich habe die nichtswürdige Grille gehabt einen unförmlichen Auszug
einer englischen Apologie des Rousseau, die den Sterne zum Verfasser
haben soll, in die <i>Königsberger Zeitung</i> einflicken zu lassen.”

It is obviously not the place here for a full discussion of this
question. Hédouin in the appendix of his “Life of Goethe” (pp. 291 ff)
urges the claims of the book and resents Fitzgerald’s rather scornful
characterization of the French critics who received the work as Sterne’s
(see Life of Sterne, 1864, II, p.&nbsp;429). Hédouin refers to Jules
Janin (“Essai sur la vie et les ouvrages de Sterne”) and Balzac
(“Physiologie du mariage,” Meditation xvii,) as citing from the work as
genuine. Barbey d’Aurevilly is, however, noted as contending in <i>la
Patrie</i> against the authenticity. This is probably the article to be
found in his collection of Essays, “XIX Siècle, Les oeuvres et les
hommes,” Paris, 1890, pp. 73&ndash;93. Fitzgerald mentions Chasles among
French critics who accept the book. Springer is incorrect in his
assertion that the Koran appeared seven years after Sterne’s death, but
he is probably building on the <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘incorect’">incorrect</ins>
statement in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> (XCIV, pp. 303 ff). Springer also asserts erroneously that it
was never published in Sterne’s collected works. He is evidently
disposed to make a case for the Koran and finds really his chief proof
in the fact that both Goethe and Jean Paul accepted it unquestioningly.
Bodmer quotes Sterne from the Koran in a letter to Denis, April 4, 1771,
“M.&nbsp;Denis Lit. Nachlass,” ed. by Retzer, Wien, 1801, II,
p.&nbsp;120, and other German authors have in a similar way made
quotations from this work, without questioning its authenticity.</p>

&nbsp;<br>
STERNE’S INFLUENCE IN GERMANY</h3>


<p>Thus in manifold ways Sterne was introduced into German life and
letters.<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_1" id = "tagV_1" href =
"#noteV_1">1</a> He stood as a figure of benignant humanity, of lavish
sympathy with every earthly affliction, he became a guide and mentor,<a
class = "tag" name = "tagV_2" id = "tagV_2" href = "#noteV_2">2</a> an
awakener and consoler, and probably more than all, a&nbsp;sanction for
emotional expression. Not only in literature, but in the conduct of life
was Yorick judged a preceptor. The most important attempt to turn
Yorick’s teachings to practical service in modifying conduct in human
relationships was the introduction and use of the so-called
“Lorenzodosen.” The considerable popularity of this remarkable conceit
is tangible evidence of Sterne’s influence in Germany and stands in
striking contrast to the wavering enthusiasm, vigorous denunciation and
half-hearted acknowledgment
<span class = "pagenum">85</span>
<a name = "page85" id = "page85"> </a>
which marked Sterne’s career in England. A&nbsp;century of criticism has
disallowed Sterne’s claim as a prophet, but unquestionably he received
in Germany the honors which a foreign land proverbially accords.</p>

<p>To Johann Georg Jacobi, the author of the “Winterreise” and
“Sommerreise,” two well-known imitations of Sterne, the sentimental
world was indebted for this practical manner of expressing adherence to
a sentimental creed.<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_3" id = "tagV_3" href
= "#noteV_3">3</a> In the <i>Hamburgischer Correspondent</i> he
published an open letter to Gleim, dated April 4, 1769, about the time
of the inception of the “Winterreise,” in which letter he relates at
considerable length the origin of the idea.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagV_4" id = "tagV_4" href = "#noteV_4">4</a> A&nbsp;few days before
this the author was reading to his brother, Fritz Jacobi, the
philosopher, novelist and friend of Goethe, and a number of ladies, from
Sterne’s Sentimental Journey the story of the poor Franciscan who begged
alms of Yorick. “We read,” says Jacobi, “how Yorick used this snuff-box
to invoke its former possessor’s gentle, patient spirit, and to keep his
own composed in the midst of life’s conflicts. The good Monk had died:
Yorick sat by his grave, took out the little snuff-box, plucked a few
nettles from the head of the grave, and wept. We looked at one another
in
<span class = "pagenum">86</span>
<a name = "page86" id = "page86"> </a>
silence: each rejoiced to find tears in the others’ eyes; we honored the
death of the venerable old man Lorenzo and the good-hearted Englishman.
In our opinion, too, the Franciscan deserved more to be canonized than
all the saints of the calendar. Gentleness, contentedness with the
world, patience invincible, pardon for the errors of mankind, these are
the primary virtues he teaches his disciples.” The moment was too
precious not to be emphasized by something rememberable, perceptible to
the senses, and they all purchased for themselves horn snuff-boxes, and
had the words “Pater Lorenzo” written in golden letters on the outside
of the cover and “Yorick” within. Oath was taken for the sake of Saint
Lorenzo to give something to every Franciscan who might ask of them, and
further: “If anyone in our company should allow himself to be carried
away by anger, his friend holds out to him the snuff-box, and we have
too much feeling to withstand this reminder even in the greatest
violence of passion.” It is suggested also that the ladies, who use no
tobacco, should at least have such a snuff-box on their night-stands,
because to them belong in such a high degree those gentle feelings which
were to be associated with the article.</p>

<p>This letter printed in the Hamburg paper was to explain the
snuff-box, which Jacobi had sent to Gleim a few days before, and the
desire is also expressed to spread the order. Hence others were sent to
other friends. Jacobi goes on to say: “Perhaps in the future, I&nbsp;may
have the pleasure of meeting a stranger here and there who will hand me
the horn snuff-box with its golden letters. I&nbsp;shall embrace him as
intimately as one Free Mason does another after the sign has been given.
Oh! what a joy it would be to me, if I could introduce so precious a
custom among my fellow-townsmen.” A&nbsp;reviewer in the <i>Allgemeine
deutsche Bibliothek</i><a class = "tag" name = "tagV_5" id = "tagV_5"
href = "#noteV_5">5</a> sharply condemns Jacobi for his conceit in
printing publicly a letter meant for his friend or friends, and, to
judge from the words with which Jacobi accompanies the abridged form of
the letter in the later editions it would seem that Jacobi himself was
later ashamed of the whole affair. The idea, however, was warmly
received,
<span class = "pagenum">87</span>
<a name = "page87" id = "page87"> </a>
and among the teary, sentimental enthusiasts the horn snuff-box soon
became the fad. A&nbsp;few days after the publication of this letter,
Wittenberg,<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_6" id = "tagV_6" href =
"#noteV_6">6</a> the journalist in Hamburg, writes to Jacobi (April 21)
that many in Hamburg desire to possess these snuff-boxes, and he adds:
“A&nbsp;hundred or so are now being manufactured; besides the name
Lorenzo, the following legend is to appear on the cover: Animae quales
non candidiores terra tulit<ins class = "correction" title = "” missing">.”</ins>
Wittenberg explains that this Latin motto was a
suggestion of his own, selfishly made, for thereby he might win the
opportunity of explaining it to the fair ladies, and exacting kisses for
the service. Wittenberg asserts that a lady (Longo guesses a certain
Johanna Friederike Behrens) was the first to suggest the manufacture of
the article at Hamburg. A&nbsp;second letter<a class = "tag" name =
"tagV_7" id = "tagV_7" href = "#noteV_7">7</a> from Wittenberg to Jacobi
four months later (August 21, 1769) announces the sending of nine
snuff-boxes to Jacobi, and the price is given as one-half a
reichsthaler. Jacobi himself says in his note to the later edition that
merchants made a speculation out of the fad, and that a multitude of
such boxes were sent out through all Germany, even to Denmark and
Livonia: “they were in every hand,” he says. Graf Solms had such boxes
made of tin with the name Jacobi inside. Both Martin and Werner instance
the request<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_8" id = "tagV_8" href =
"#noteV_8">8</a> of a Protestant vicar, Johann David Goll in Trossingen,
for a “Lorenzodose” with the promise to subscribe to the oath of the
order, and, though Protestant, to name the Catholic Franciscan his
brother. According to a spicy review<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_9" id
= "tagV_9" href = "#noteV_9">9</a> in the <i>Allgemeine deutsche
Bibliothek</i><a class = "tag" name = "tagV_10" id = "tagV_10" href =
"#noteV_10">10</a> these snuff-boxes were sold in Hamburg wrapped in a
printed copy of Jacobi’s letter to Gleim, and the reviewer adds, <ins
class = "correction" title = "“ missing">“</ins>like Grenough’s
tooth-tincture in the directions
<span class = "pagenum">88</span>

for its use.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_11" id = "tagV_11" href =

cult with evident ridicule.<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_12" id =
"tagV_12" href = "#noteV_12">12</a></p>

<p>There were other efforts to make Yorick’s example an efficient power
of beneficent brotherliness. Kaufmann attempted to found a Lorenzo order
of the horn snuff-box. Düntzer, in his study of Kaufmann,<a class =
"tag" name = "tagV_13" id = "tagV_13" href = "#noteV_13">13</a> states
that this was only an effort on Kaufmann’s part to embrace a timely
opportunity to make himself prominent. This endeavor was made according
to Düntzer, during Kaufmann’s residence in Strassburg, which the
investigator assigns to the years 1774&ndash;75. Leuchsenring,<a class =
"tag" name = "tagV_14" id = "tagV_14" href = "#noteV_14">14</a> the
eccentric sentimentalist, who for a time belonged to the Darmstadt
circle and whom Goethe satirized in “Pater Brey,” cherished also for a
time the idea of founding an order of “Empfindsamkeit<ins class =
"correction" title = "” missing">.”&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>In the literary remains of Johann Christ Hofmann<a class = "tag" name
= "tagV_15" id = "tagV_15" href = "#noteV_15">15</a> in Coburg was found
the “patent” of an order of “Sanftmuth und Versöhnung.”
A&nbsp;“Lorenzodose” was found with it marked XXVIII, and the seven
rules of the order, dated Coburg “im Ordens-Comtoir, den 10 August,
1769,” are merely a topical enlargement and ordering of Jacobi’s
original idea. Longo
<span class = "pagenum">89</span>
<a name = "page89" id = "page89"> </a>
gives them in full. Appell states that Jacobi explained through a friend
that he knew nothing of this order and had no share in its founding.
Longo complains that Appell does not give the source of his information,
but Jacobi in his note to the so-called “Stiftungs-Brief” in the edition
of 1807 quotes the article in Schlichtegroll’s “Nekrolog” as his only
knowledge of this order, certainly implying his previous ignorance of
its existence.</p>

<p>Somewhat akin to these attempts to incorporate Yorick’s ideas is the
fantastic laying out of the park at Marienwerder near Hanover, of which
Matthison writes in his “Vaterländische Besuche,”<a class = "tag" name =
"tagV_16" id = "tagV_16" href = "#noteV_16">16</a> and in a letter to
the Hofrath von Köpken in Magdeburg,<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_17" id
= "tagV_17" href = "#noteV_17">17</a> dated October 17, 1785. After a
sympathetic description of the secluded park, he tells how labyrinthine
paths lead to an eminence “where the unprepared stranger is surprised by
the sight of a cemetery. On the crosses there one reads beloved names
from Yorick’s Journey and Tristram Shandy. Father Lorenzo, Eliza, Maria
of Moulines, Corporal Trim, Uncle Toby and Yorick were gathered by a
poetic fancy to this graveyard.” The letter gives a similar description
and adds the epitaph on Trim’s monument, “Weed his grave clean, ye men
of goodness, for he was your brother,”<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_18"
id = "tagV_18" href = "#noteV_18">18</a> a&nbsp;quotation, which in its
fuller form, Matthison uses in a letter<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_19"
id = "tagV_19" href = "#noteV_19">19</a> to Bonstetten, Heidelberg,
February 7, 1794, in speaking of Böck the actor. It is impossible to
determine whose eccentric and tasteless enthusiasm is represented by
this mortuary arrangement.</p>

<p>Louise von Ziegler, known in the Darmstadt circle as Lila, whom Merck
admired and, according to Caroline Flaschsland, “almost compared with
Yorick’s Maria,” was so sentimental that she had her grave made in her
garden, evidently for purposes of contemplation, and she led a lamb
about which ate and drank with her. Upon the death of this animal,
“a&nbsp;faithful dog” took its place. Thus was Maria of Moulines
remembered.<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_20" id = "tagV_20" href =
"#noteV_20">20</a></p>

<span class = "pagenum">90</span>
<a name = "page90" id = "page90"> </a>
<p>It has already been noted that Yorick’s sympathy for the brute
creation found cordial response in Germany, such regard being accepted
as a part of his message. That the spread of such sentimental notions
was not confined to the printed word, but passed over into actual
regulation of conduct is admirably illustrated by an anecdote related in
Wieland’s <i>Teutscher Merkur</i> in the January number for 1776, by a
correspondent who signs himself “S.” A&nbsp;friend was visiting him;
they went to walk, and the narrator having his gun with him shot with it
two young doves. His friend is exercised. “What have the doves done to
you?” he queries. “Nothing,” is the reply, “but they will taste good to
you.” “But they were alive,” interposed the friend, “and would have
caressed (geschnäbelt) one another,” and later he refuses to partake of
the doves. Connection with Yorick is established by the narrator
himself: “If my friend had not read Yorick’s story about the sparrow, he
would have had no rule of conduct here about shooting doves, and my
doves would have tasted better to him.” The influence of Yorick was,
however, quite possibly indirect through Jacobi as intermediary; for the
latter describes a sentimental family who refused to allow their doves
to be killed. The author of this letter, however, refers directly to
Yorick, to the very similar episode of the sparrows narrated in the
continuation of the Sentimental Journey, but an adventure original with
the German Bode. This is probably the source of Jacobi’s narrative.</p>

<p>The other side of Yorick’s character, less comprehensible, less
capable of translation into tangibilities, was not disregarded. His
humor and whimsicality, though much less potent, were yet influential.
Ramler said in a letter to Gebler dated November 14, 1775, that everyone
wished to jest like Sterne,<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_21" id =
"tagV_21" href = "#noteV_21">21</a> and the <i>Frankfurter Gelehrte
Anzeigen</i> (October 31, 1775), at almost precisely the same time,
discourses at some length on the then prevailing epidemic of
whimsicality, showing that shallowness beheld in the then existing
interest in
<span class = "pagenum">91</span>
<a name = "page91" id = "page91"> </a>
humor a justification for all sorts of eccentric behavior and
inconsistent wilfulness.</p>

<p>Naturally Sterne’s influence in the world of letters may be traced
most obviously in the slavish imitation of his style, his sentiment, his
whims,&mdash;this phase represented in general by now forgotten
triflers; but it also enters into the thought of the great minds in the
fatherland and becomes interwoven with their culture. Their own
expressions of indebtedness are here often available in assigning a
measure of relationship. And finally along certain general lines the
German Yorick exercised an influence over the way men thought and wanted
to think.</p>

<p>The direct imitations of Sterne are very numerous, a&nbsp;crowd of
followers, a&nbsp;motley procession of would-be Yoricks, set out on one
expedition or another. Musäus<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_22" id =
"tagV_22" href = "#noteV_22">22</a> in a review of certain sentimental
meanderings in the <i>Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek</i>,<a class =
"tag" name = "tagV_23" id = "tagV_23" href = "#noteV_23">23</a> remarked
that the increase of such journeyings threatened to bring about a new
epoch in the taste of the time. He adds that the good Yorick presumably
never anticipated becoming the founder of a fashionable sect. This was
in 1773. Other expressions of alarm or disapprobation might be
cited.</p>

<p>Through Sterne’s influence the account of travels became more
personal, less purely topographical, more volatile and merry, more
subjective.<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_24" id = "tagV_24" href =
"#noteV_24">24</a> Goethe in a passage in the “Campagne in Frankreich,”
to which reference is made later, acknowledges this impulse as derived
from Yorick. Its presence was felt even when there was no outward effort
at sentimental journeying. The suggestion that the record of a journey
<span class = "pagenum">92</span>
<a name = "page92" id = "page92"> </a>
was personal and tinged with humor was essential to its popularity. It
was probably purely an effort to make use of this appeal which led the
author of “Bemerkungen eines Reisenden durch Deutschland, Frankreich,
England und Holland,”<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_25" id = "tagV_25"
href = "#noteV_25">25</a> a&nbsp;work of purely practical observation,
to place upon his title-page the alluring lines from Gay: “Life is a
jest and all things shew it. I&nbsp;thought so once, but now I know it;”
a&nbsp;promise of humorous attitude which does not find fulfilment in
the heavy volumes of purely objective description which follow.</p>

<p>Probably the first German book to bear the name Yorick in its title
was a short satirical sketch entitled, “Yorick und die Bibliothek der
elenden Scribenten, an Hrn.&mdash;” 1768,&nbsp;8<sup>o</sup>
(Anspach),<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_26" id = "tagV_26" href =
"#noteV_26">26</a> which is linked to the quite disgustingly scurrilous
Antikriticus controversy.</p>

<p>Attempts at whimsicality, imitations also of the Shandean gallery of
originals appear, and the more particularly Shandean style of narration
is adopted in the novels of the period which deal with middle-class
domestic life. Of books directly inspired by Sterne, or following more
or less slavishly his guidance, a&nbsp;considerable proportion has
undoubtedly been consigned to merited oblivion. In many cases it is
possible to determine from contemporary reviews the nature of the
individual product, and the probable extent of indebtedness to the
British model. If it were possible to find and examine them all with a
view to establishing extent of relationship, the identity of motifs, the
borrowing of thought and sentiment, such a work would give us little
more than we learn from consideration of representative examples. In the
following chapter the attempt will be made to treat a number of typical
products. Baker in his article on Sterne in Germany adopts the rather
hazardous expedient of judging merely by title and taking from Goedeke’s
“Grundriss,” works which suggests a dependence on Sterne.<a class =
"tag" name = "tagV_27" id = "tagV_27" href = "#noteV_27">27</a></p>

<span class = "pagenum">93</span>
<a name = "page93" id = "page93"> </a>
<p>The early relation of several great men of letters to Sterne has been
already treated in connection with the gradual awakening of Germany to
the new force. Wieland was one of Sterne’s most ardent admirers, one of
his most intelligent interpreters; but since his relationship to Sterne
has been made the theme of special study,<a class = "tag" name =
"tagV_28" id = "tagV_28" href = "#noteV_28">28</a> there will be needed
here but a brief recapitulation with some additional comment. Especially
in the productions of the years 1768&ndash;1774 are the direct allusions
to Sterne and his works numerous, the adaptations of motifs frequent,
and imitation of literary style unmistakable. Behmer finds no
demonstrable evidence of Sterne’s influence in Wieland’s work prior to
two poems of the year 1768, “Endymions Traum” and “Chloe;” but in the
works of the years immediately following there is abundant evidence both
in style and in subject matter, in the fund of allusion and
illustration, to establish the author’s indebtedness to Sterne. Behmer
analyzes from this standpoint the following works: “Beiträge zur
geheimen Geschichte des menschlichen Verstandes und Herzens;” “Sokrates
Mainomenos oder die Dialogen
<span class = "pagenum">94</span>
<a name = "page94" id = "page94"> </a>
des Diogenes von Sinope;” “Der neue Amadis;” “Der goldene Spiegel;”
“Geschichte des Philosophen Danischmende;” “Gedanken über eine alte
Aufschrift;” “Geschichte der Abderiten.”<a class = "tag" name =
"tagV_29" id = "tagV_29" href = "#noteV_29">29</a></p>

<p>In these works, but in different measure in each, Behmer finds Sterne
copied stylistically, in the constant conversations about the worth of
the book, the comparative value of the different chapters and the
difficulty of managing the material, in the fashion of inconsequence in
unexplained beginnings and abrupt endings, in the heaping up of words of
similar meaning, or similar ending, and in the frequent digressions.
Sterne also is held responsible for the manner of introducing the
immorally suggestive, for the introduction of learned quotations and
references to authorities, for the sport made of the learned professions
and the satire upon all kinds of pedantry and overwrought enthusiasm.
Though the direct, demonstrable influence of Sterne upon Wieland’s
literary activity dies out gradually<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_30" id
= "tagV_30" href = "#noteV_30">30</a> and naturally, with the growth of
his own genius, his admiration for the English favorite abides with him,
passing on into succeeding periods of his development, as his former
enthusiasm for Richardson failed to do.<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_31"
id = "tagV_31" href = "#noteV_31">31</a> More than twenty years later,
when more sober days had stilled the first unbridled outburst of
sentimentalism, Wieland speaks yet of Sterne in terms of unaltered
devotion: in an article published in the <i>Merkur</i>,<a class = "tag"
name = "tagV_32" id = "tagV_32" href = "#noteV_32">32</a> Sterne is
called among all authors the one “from whom I would last part,”<a class
= "tag" name = "tagV_33" id = "tagV_33" href = "#noteV_33">33</a> and
the subject of the article itself is an indication of his concern for
the fate of Yorick among his fellow-countrymen. It is in the form of an
epistle to Herr .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. zu D., and is a vigorous protest
against heedless imitation of Sterne, representing chiefly the perils of
such endeavor and the bathos of the failure. Wieland includes in
<span class = "pagenum">95</span>
<a name = "page95" id = "page95"> </a>
the letter some “specimen passages from a novel in the style of Tristram
Shandy,” which he asserts were sent him by the author. The quotations
are almost flat burlesque in their impossible idiocy, and one can easily
appreciate Wieland’s despairing cry with which the article ends.</p>

<p>A few words of comment upon Behmer’s work will be in place. He
accepts as genuine the two added volumes of the Sentimental Journey and
the Koran, though he admits that the former were published by a friend,
not “without additions of his own,” and he uses these volumes directly
at least in one instance in establishing his parallels, the rescue of
the naked woman from the fire in the third volume of the Journey, and
the similar rescue from the waters in the “Nachlass des Diogenes.”<a
class = "tag" name = "tagV_34" id = "tagV_34" href = "#noteV_34">34</a>
That Sterne had any connection with these volumes is improbable, and the
Koran is surely a pure fabrication. Behmer seeks in a few words to deny
the reproach cast upon Sterne that he had no understanding of the
beauties of nature, but Behmer is certainly claiming too much when he
speaks of the “Farbenprächtige Schilderungen der ihm ungewohnten
sonnenverklärten Landschaft,” which Sterne gives us “repeatedly” in the
Sentimental Journey, and he finds his most secure evidence for Yorick’s
“genuine and pure” feeling for nature in the oft-quoted passage
beginning, “I&nbsp;pity the man who can travel from Dan to Beersheba and
cry ‘’Tis all barren.’” It would surely be difficult to find these
repeated instances, for, in the whole work, Sterne gives absolutely no
description of natural scenery beyond the most casual, incidental
reference: the familiar passage is also misinterpreted, it betrays no
appreciation of inanimate nature in itself, and is but a cry in
condemnation of those who fail to find exercise for their sympathetic
emotions. Sterne mentions the “sweet myrtle” and “melancholy cypress,”<a
class = "tag" name = "tagV_35" id = "tagV_35" href = "#noteV_35">35</a>
not as indicative of his own affection for nature, but as exemplifying
his own exceeding personal need of expenditure of human sympathy, as
indeed the
<span class = "pagenum">96</span>
<a name = "page96" id = "page96"> </a>
very limit to which sensibility can go, when the desert denies
possibility of human intercourse. Sterne’s attitude is much better
illustrated at the beginning of the “Road to Versailles”: “As there was
nothing in this road, or rather nothing which I look for in traveling,
I&nbsp;cannot fill up the blank better than with a short history of this
self-same bird.” In other words, he met no possibility for exercising
the emotions. Behmer’s statement with reference to Sterne, “that his
authorship proceeds anyway from a parody of Richardson,” is surely not
demonstrable, nor that “this whole fashion of composition is indeed but
ridicule of Richardson.” Richardson’s star had paled perceptibly before
Sterne began to write, and the period of his immense popularity lies
nearly twenty years before. There is not the slightest reason to suppose
that his works have any connection whatsoever with Richardson’s novels.
One is tempted to think that Behmer confuses Sterne with Fielding, whose
career as a novelist did begin as a parodist of the vain little printer.
That the “Starling” in the Sentimental Journey, which is passed on from
hand to hand, and the burden of government which wanders similarly in
“Der Goldene Spiegel” constitute a parallelism, as Behmer suggests
(p.&nbsp;48), seems rather far-fetched. It could also be hardly
demonstrated that what Behmer calls “die Sternische Einführungsweise”<a
class = "tag" name = "tagV_36" id = "tagV_36" href = "#noteV_36">36</a>
(p.&nbsp;54), as used in the “Geschichte der Abderiten,” is peculiar to
Sterne or even characteristic of him. Behmer (p.&nbsp;19) seems to be
ignorant of any reprints or translations of the Koran, the letters and
the sermons, save those coming from Switzerland.</p>

<p>Bauer’s study of the Sterne-Wieland relation is much briefer
(thirty-five pages) and much less satisfactory because less thorough,
yet it contains some few valuable individual points and cited
parallelisms. Bauer errs in stating that Shandy appeared 1759&ndash;67
in York, implying that the whole work was issued there. He gives the
dates of Sterne’s first visit to Paris, also incorrectly, as
1760&ndash;62.</p>

<p>Finally, Wieland cannot be classed among the slavish
<span class = "pagenum">97</span>
<a name = "page97" id = "page97"> </a>
imitators of Yorick; he is too independent a thinker, too insistent a
pedagogue to allow himself to be led more than outwardly by the foreign
model. He has something of his own to say and is genuinely serious in a
large portion of his own philosophic speculations: hence, his connection
with Sterne, being largely stylistic and illustrative, may be designated
as a drapery of foreign humor about his own seriousness of theorizing.
Wieland’s Hellenic tendencies make the use of British humor all the more
incongruous.<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_37" id = "tagV_37" href =
"#noteV_37">37</a></p>

<p>Herder’s early acquaintance with Sterne has been already treated.
Subsequent writings offer also occasional indication of an abiding
admiration. Soon after his arrival in Paris he wrote to Hartknoch
praising Sterne’s characterization of the French people.<a class = "tag"
name = "tagV_38" id = "tagV_38" href = "#noteV_38">38</a> The fifth
“Wäldchen,” which is concerned with the laughable, contains reference to
Sterne.<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_39" id = "tagV_39" href =
"#noteV_39">39</a></p>

<p>With Lessing the case is similar: a striking statement of personal
regard has been recorded, but Lessing’s literary work of the following
years does not betray a significant influence from Yorick. To be sure,
allusion is made to Sterne a few times in letters<a class = "tag" name =
"tagV_40" id = "tagV_40" href = "#noteV_40">40</a> and elsewhere, but no
direct manifestation of devotion is discoverable. The compelling
consciousness of his own message, his vigorous interest in deeper
problems of religion and philosophy, the then increasing worth of native
German literature, may well have overshadowed the influence of the
volatile Briton.</p>

<p>Goethe’s expressions of admiration for Sterne and indebtedness to him
are familiar. Near the end of his life (December 16, 1828), when the
poet was interested in observing the history and sources of his own
culture, and was intent upon recording
<span class = "pagenum">98</span>
<a name = "page98" id = "page98"> </a>
his own experience for the edification and clarification of the people,
he says in conversation with Eckermann: “I&nbsp;am infinitely indebted
to Shakespeare, Sterne and Goldsmith.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_41"
id = "tagV_41" href = "#noteV_41">41</a> And a year later in a letter to
Zelter,<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_42" id = "tagV_42" href =
"#noteV_42">42</a> (Weimar, December 25, 1829), “The influence Goldsmith
and Sterne exercised upon me, just at the chief point of my development,
cannot be estimated. This high, benevolent irony, this just and
comprehensive way of viewing things, this gentleness to all opposition,
this equanimity under every change, and whatever else all the kindred
virtues may be termed&mdash;such things were a most admirable training
for me, and surely, these are the sentiments which in the end lead us
back from all the mistaken paths of life.”</p>

<p>In the same conversation with Eckermann from which the first
quotation is made, Goethe seems to defy the investigator who would
endeavor to define his indebtedness to Sterne, its nature and its
measure. The occasion was an attempt on the part of certain writers to
determine the authorship of certain distichs printed in both Schiller’s
and Goethe’s works. Upon a remark of Eckermann’s that this effort to
hunt down a man’s originality and to trace sources is very common in the
literary world, Goethe says: “Das ist sehr lächerlich, man könnte ebenso
gut einen wohlgenährten Mann nach den Ochsen, Schafen und Schweinen
fragen, die er gegessen und die ihm Kräfte gegeben.” An investigation
such as Goethe seems to warn us against here would be one of tremendous
difficulty, a&nbsp;theme for a separate work. It is purposed here to
gather only information with reference to Goethe’s expressed or implied
attitude toward Sterne, his opinion of the British master, and to note
certain connections between Goethe’s work and that of Sterne,
connections which are obvious or have been already a matter of comment
and discussion.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">99</span>
<a name = "page99" id = "page99"> </a>
<p>In Strassburg under Herder’s<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_43" id =
"tagV_43" href = "#noteV_43">43</a> guidance, Goethe seems first to have
read the works of Sterne. His life in Frankfurt during the interval
between his two periods of university residence was not of a nature
calculated to increase his acquaintance with current literature, and his
studies did not lead to interest in literary novelty. This is his own
statement in “Dichtung und Wahrheit.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_44"
id = "tagV_44" href = "#noteV_44">44</a> That Herder’s enthusiasm for
Sterne was generous has already been shown by letters written in the few
years previous to his sojourn in Strassburg. Letters written to Merck<a
class = "tag" name = "tagV_45" id = "tagV_45" href = "#noteV_45">45</a>
(Strassburg, 1770&ndash;1771) would seem to show that then too Sterne
still stood high in his esteem. Whatever the exact time of Goethe’s
first acquaintance with Sterne, we know that he recommended the British
writer to Jung-Stilling for the latter’s cultivation in letters.<a class
= "tag" name = "tagV_46" id = "tagV_46" href = "#noteV_46">46</a> Less
than a year after Goethe’s departure from Strassburg, we find him
reading aloud to the Darmstadt circle the story of poor Le Fevre from
Tristram Shandy. This is reported in a letter, dated May 8, 1772, by
Caroline Flachsland, Herder’s fiancée.<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_47"
id = "tagV_47" href = "#noteV_47">47</a> It is not evident whether they
read Sterne in the original or in the translation of Zückert, the only
one then available, unless possibly the reader gave a translation as he
read. Later in the same letter, Caroline mentions the “Empfindsame
Reisen,” possibly meaning Bode’s translation. She also records reading
Shakespeare in Wieland’s rendering, but as she speaks later still of
peeping into the English books which Herder had sent Merck, it is a
hazardous thing to reason from her mastery of English at that time to
the use of original or translation on the occasion of Goethe’s
reading.</p>

<p>Contemporary criticism saw in the Martin of “Götz von Berlichingen”
a&nbsp;likeness to Sterne’s creations;<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_48"
id = "tagV_48" href = "#noteV_48">48</a> and in the other
<span class = "pagenum">100</span>
<a name = "page100" id = "page100"> </a>
great work of the pre-Weimarian period, in “Werther,” though no direct
influence rewards one’s search, one must acknowledge the presence of a
mental and emotional state to which Sterne was a contributor. Indeed
Goethe himself suggests this relationship. Speaking of “Werther” in the
“Campagne in Frankreich,”<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_49" id =
"tagV_49" href = "#noteV_49">49</a> he observes in a well-known passage
that Werther did not cause the disease, only exposed it, and that Yorick
shared in preparing the ground-work of sentimentalism on which “Werther”
is built.</p>

<p>According to the quarto edition of 1837, the first series of letters
from Switzerland dates from 1775, although they were not published till
1808, in the eleventh volume of the edition begun in 1806. Scherer, in
his “History of German Literature,” asserts that these letters are
written in imitation of Sterne, but it is difficult to see the occasion
for such a statement. The letters are, in spite of all haziness
concerning the time of their origin and Goethe’s exact purpose regarding
them,<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_50" id = "tagV_50" href =
"#noteV_50">50</a> a&nbsp;“fragment of Werther’s travels” and are
confessedly cast in a sentimental tone, which one might easily attribute
to a Werther, in whom hyperesthesia has not yet developed to delirium,
an earlier Werther. Yorick’s whim and sentiment are quite wanting, and
the sensuousness, especially as pertains to corporeal beauty, is
distinctly Goethean.</p>

<p>Goethe’s accounts of his own travels are quite free from the Sterne
flavor; in fact he distinctly says that through the influence of the
Sentimental Journey all records of journeys had been mostly given up to
the feelings and opinions of the traveler, but that he, after his
Italian journey, had endeavored to keep himself objective.<a class =
"tag" name = "tagV_51" id = "tagV_51" href = "#noteV_51">51</a></p>

<p>Dr. Robert Riemann in his study of Goethe’s novels,<a class = "tag"
name = "tagV_52" id = "tagV_52" href = "#noteV_52">52</a> calls
Friedrich in “Wilhelm Meister’s Lehrjahre” a&nbsp;representative of
Sterne’s humor, and he finds in Mittler in the “Wahlverwandtschaften”
a&nbsp;union of seriousness and the comic of caricature,
<span class = "pagenum">101</span>
<a name = "page101" id = "page101"> </a>
reminiscent of Sterne and Hippel. Friedrich is mercurial, petulant,
utterly irresponsible, a&nbsp;creature of mirth and laughter, subject to
unreasoning fits of passion. One might, in thinking of another character
in fiction, designate Friedrich as faun-like. In all of this one can,
however, find little if any demonstrable likeness to Sterne or Sterne’s
creations. It is rather difficult also to see wherein the character of
Mittler is reminiscent of Sterne. Mittler is introduced with the obvious
purpose of representing certain opinions and of aiding the development
of the story by his insistence upon them. He represents a brusque,
practical kind of benevolence, and his eccentricity lies only in the
extraordinary occupation which he has chosen for himself. Riemann also
traces to Sterne, Fielding and their German followers, Goethe’s
occasional use of the direct appeal to the reader. Doubtless Sterne’s
example here was a force in extending this rhetorical convention.</p>

<p>It is claimed by Goebel<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_53" id =
"tagV_53" href = "#noteV_53">53</a> that Goethe’s “Homunculus,”
suggested to the master partly by reading of Paracelsus and partly by
Sterne’s mediation, is in some characteristics of his being dependent
directly on Sterne’s creation. In a meeting of the “Gesellschaft für
deutsche Litteratur,” November, 1896, Brandl expressed the opinion that
Maria of Moulines was a prototype of Mignon in “Wilhelm Meister.”<a
class = "tag" name = "tagV_54" id = "tagV_54" href =
"#noteV_54">54</a></p>

<p>The references to Sterne in Goethe’s works, in his letters and
conversations, are fairly numerous in the aggregate, but not especially
striking relatively. In the conversations with Eckermann there are
several other allusions besides those already mentioned. Goethe calls
Eckermann a second Shandy for suffering illness without calling a
physician, even as Walter Shandy failed to attend to the squeaking
door-hinge.<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_55" id = "tagV_55" href =
"#noteV_55">55</a> Eckermann himself draws on Sterne for illustrations
in Yorick’s description of Paris,<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_56" id =
"tagV_56" href = "#noteV_56">56</a> and on January 24, 1830, at a time
when we know that Goethe was re-reading Sterne, Eckermann refers
<span class = "pagenum">102</span>
<a name = "page102" id = "page102"> </a>
to Yorick’s (?) doctrine of the reasonable use of grief.<a class = "tag"
name = "tagV_57" id = "tagV_57" href = "#noteV_57">57</a> That Goethe
near the end of his life turned again to Sterne’s masterpiece is proved
by a letter to Zelter, October 5, 1830;<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_58"
id = "tagV_58" href = "#noteV_58">58</a> he adds here too that his
admiration has increased with the years, speaking particularly of
Sterne’s gay arraignment of pedantry and philistinism. But a few days
before this, October 1, 1830, in a conversation reported by Riemer,<a
class = "tag" name = "tagV_59" id = "tagV_59" href = "#noteV_59">59</a>
he expresses the same opinion and adds that Sterne was the first to
raise himself and us from pedantry and philistinism. By these remarks
Goethe commits himself in at least one respect to a favorable view of
Sterne’s influence on German letters. A&nbsp;few other minor allusions
to Sterne may be of interest. In an article in the <i>Horen</i> (1795,
V<ins class = "correction" title = ". missing">.&nbsp;</ins>Stück,)
entitled “Literarischer Sansculottismus,” Goethe mentions Smelfungus as
a type of growler.<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_60" id = "tagV_60" href
= "#noteV_60">60</a> In the “Wanderjahre”<a class = "tag" name =
"tagV_61" id = "tagV_61" href = "#noteV_61">61</a> there is a reference
to Yorick’s classification of travelers. Düntzer, in Schnorr’s
<i>Archiv</i>,<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_62" id = "tagV_62" href =
"#noteV_62">62</a> explains a passage in a letter of Goethe’s to Johanna
Fahlmer (August, 1775), “die Verworrenheiten des Diego und Juliens” as
an allusion to the “Intricacies of Diego and Julia” in Slawkenbergius’s
tale,<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_63" id = "tagV_63" href =
"#noteV_63">63</a> and to the traveler’s conversation with his beast. In
a letter to Frau von Stein<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_64" id =
"tagV_64" href = "#noteV_64">64</a> five years later (September 18,
1780) Goethe used this same expression, and the editor of the letters
avails himself of Düntzer’s explanation. Düntzer further explains the
word <span class = "greek" title = "theodokos">θεοδοκος</span>, used in
Goethe’s Tagebuch with reference to the Duke, in connection with the
term <span class = "greek" title = "theodidaktos">θεοδιδακτος</span>
applied to Walter Shandy. The word&nbsp;is,
<span class = "pagenum">103</span>
<a name = "page103" id = "page103"> </a>
however, somewhat illegible in the manuscript. It was printed thus in
the edition of the Tagebuch published by Robert Keil, but when Düntzer
himself, nine years after the article in the <i>Archiv</i>, published an
edition of the Tagebücher he accepted a reading <span class = "greek"
title = "theotatos">θεοτατος</span>,<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_65" id
= "tagV_65" href = "#noteV_65">65</a> meaning, as he says, “ein voller
Gott,” thereby tacitly retracting his former theory of connection with
Sterne.</p>

<p>The best known relationship between Goethe and Sterne is in
connection with the so-called plagiarisms in the appendix to the third
volume of the “Wanderjahre.” Here, in the second edition, were printed
under the title “Aus Makariens Archiv” various maxims and sentiments.
Among these were a number of sayings, reflections, axioms, which were
later discovered to have been taken bodily from the second part of the
Koran, the best known Sterne-forgery. Alfred Hédouin, in “Le Monde
Maçonnique” (1863), in an article “Goethe plagiaire de Sterne,” first
located the quotations.<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_66" id = "tagV_66"
href = "#noteV_66">66</a></p>

<p>Mention has already been made of the account of Robert Springer,
which is probably the last published essay on the subject. It is
entitled “Ist Goethe ein Plagiarius Lorenz Sternes?” and is found in the
volume “Essays zur Kritik und Philosophie und zur Goethe-Litteratur.”<a
class = "tag" name = "tagV_67" id = "tagV_67" href = "#noteV_67">67</a>
Springer cites at some length the liberal opinions of Molière, La
Bruyère, Wieland, Heine and others concerning the literary appropriation
of another’s thought. He then proceeds to quote Goethe’s equally
generous views on the subject, and adds the uncritical fling that if
Goethe robbed Sterne, it was an honor to Sterne, a&nbsp;gain to his
literary fame. Near the end of his paper, Springer arrives at the
question in hand and states positively that these maxims, with their
miscellaneous companions, were never published by Goethe, but were found
by the editors of his literary remains among his miscellaneous papers,
and then issued in the
<span class = "pagenum">104</span>
<a name = "page104" id = "page104"> </a>
ninth volume of the posthumous works. Hédouin had suggested this
possible explanation. Springer adds that the editors were unaware of the
source of this material and supposed it to be original with Goethe.</p>

<p>The facts of the case are, however, as follows: “Wilhelm Meister’s
Wanderjahre” was published first in 1821.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagV_68" id = "tagV_68" href = "#noteV_68">68</a> In 1829, a&nbsp;new
and revised edition was issued in the “Ausgabe letzter Hand.” Eckermann
in his conversations with Goethe<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_69" id =
"tagV_69" href = "#noteV_69">69</a> relates the circumstances under
which the appendices were added to the earlier work. When the book was
in press, the publisher discovered that of the three volumes planned,
the last two were going to be too thin, and begged for more material to
fill out their scantiness. In this perplexity Goethe brought to
Eckermann two packets of miscellaneous notes to be edited and added to
those two slender volumes. In this way arose the collection of sayings,
scraps and quotations “Im Sinne der Wanderer” and “Aus Makariens
Archiv.” It was later agreed that Eckermann, when Goethe’s literary
remains should be published, should place the matter elsewhere, ordered
into logical divisions of thought. All of the sentences here under
special consideration were published in the twenty-third volume of the
“Ausgabe letzter Hand,” which is dated 1830,<a class = "tag" name =
"tagV_70" id = "tagV_70" href = "#noteV_70">70</a> and are to be found
there, on pages 271&ndash;275 and 278&ndash;281. They are reprinted in
the identical order in the ninth volume of the “Nachgelassene Werke,”
which also bore the title, Vol. XLIX of “Ausgabe letzter Hand,” there
found on pages 121&ndash;125 and 127&ndash;131. Evidently Springer found
them here in the posthumous works, and did not look for them in the
previous volume, which was published two years or thereabouts before
Goethe’s death.</p>

<p>Of the sentiments, sentences and quotations dealing with Sterne,
there are twenty which are translations from the Koran, in Loeper’s
edition of “Sprüche in Prosa,”<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_71" id =
"tagV_71" href = "#noteV_71">71</a> Nos. 491&ndash;507 and
543&ndash;544; seventeen others (Nos. 490, 508&ndash;509, 521&ndash;533,
<span class = "pagenum">105</span>
<a name = "page105" id = "page105"> </a>
535) contain direct appreciative criticism of Sterne; No. 538 is a
comment upon a Latin quotation in the Koran and No. 545 is a translation
of another quotation in the same work. No. 532 gives a quotation from
Sterne, “Ich habe mein Elend nicht wie ein weiser Mann benutzt,” which
Loeper says he has been unable to find in any of Sterne’s works. It is,
however, in a letter<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_72" id = "tagV_72"
href = "#noteV_72">72</a> to John Hall Stevenson, written probably in
August, 1761. The translation here is inexact. Loeper did not succeed in
finding Nos. 534, 536, 537, although their position indicates that they
were quotations from Sterne, but No. 534 is in a letter to Garrick from
Paris, March 19, 1762. The German translation however conveys a
different impression from the original English. The other two are not
located; in spite of their position, the way in which the book was put
together would certainly allow for the possibility of extraneous
material creeping in. At their first appearance in the “Ausgabe letzter
Hand,” five Sprüche, Nos. 491, 543, 534, 536, 537, were supplied with
quotation marks, though the source was not indicated. Thus it is seen
that the most of the quotations were published as original during
Goethe’s lifetime, but he probably never considered it of sufficient
consequence to disavow their authorship in public. It is quite possible
that the way in which they were forced into “Wilhelm Meister” was
distasteful to him afterwards, and he did not care to call attention to
them.</p>

<p>Goethe’s opinion of Sterne as expressed in the sentiments which
accompany the quotations from the Koran is significant. “Yorick Sterne,”
he says, “war der schönste Geist, der je gewirkt hat; wer ihn liest,
fühlet sich sogleich frei und schön; sein Humor ist unnachahmlich, und
nicht jeder Humor befreit die Seele” (490). “Sagacität und Penetration
sind bei ihm grenzenlos” (528). Goethe asserts here that every person of
culture should at that very time read Sterne’s works, so that the
nineteenth century might learn “what we owed him and perceive what we
might owe him.” Goethe took Sterne’s narrative of his journey as a
representation of an actual trip, or else he is speaking of Sterne’s
letters in the following:</p>

<span class = "pagenum">106</span>
<a name = "page106" id = "page106"> </a>
<p>“Seine Heiterkeit, Genügsamkeit, Duldsamkeit auf der Reise, wo diese
Eigenschaften am meisten geprüft werden, finden nicht leicht
Ihresgleichen” (No. 529), and Goethe’s opinion of Sterne’s indecency is
characteristic of Goethe’s attitude. He says: “Das Element der
Lüsternheit, in dem er sich so zierlich und sinnig benimmt, würde vielen
Andern zum Verderben gereichen.”</p>

<p>The juxtaposition of these quotations and this appreciation of Sterne
is proof sufficient that Goethe considered Sterne the author of the
Koran at the time when the notes were made. At precisely what time this
occurred it is now impossible to determine, but the drift of the
comment, combined with our knowledge from sources already mentioned,
that Goethe turned again to Sterne in the latter years of his life,
would indicate that the quotations were made in the latter part of the
twenties, and that the re-reading of Sterne included the Koran. Since
the translations which Goethe gives are not identical with those in the
rendering ascribed to Bode (1778), Loeper suggests Goethe himself as the
translator of the individual quotations. Loeper is ignorant of the
earlier translation of Gellius, which Goethe may have used.<a class =
"tag" name = "tagV_73" id = "tagV_73" href = "#noteV_73">73</a></p>

<p>There is yet another possibility of connection between Goethe and the
Koran. This work contained the story of the Graf von Gleichen, which is
acknowledged to have been a precursor of Goethe’s “Stella.” Düntzer in
his “Erläuterungen zu den deutschen Klassikern” says it is impossible to
determine whence Goethe took the story for “Stella.” He mentions that it
was contained in Bayle’s Dictionary, which is known to have been in
Goethe’s father’s library, and two other books, both dating from the
sixteenth century, are noted as possible sources. It seems rather more
probable that Goethe found the story in the Koran, which was published
but a few years before “Stella” was written and translated but a year
later,
<span class = "pagenum">107</span>
<a name = "page107" id = "page107"> </a>
1771, that is, but four years, or even less, before the appearance of
“Stella” (1775).<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_74" id = "tagV_74" href =
"#noteV_74">74</a></p>

<p>Precisely in the spirit of the opinions quoted above is the little
essay<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_75" id = "tagV_75" href =
"#noteV_75">75</a> on Sterne which was published in the sixth volume of
“Ueber Kunst und Alterthum,” in which Goethe designates Sterne as a man
“who first stimulated and propagated the great epoch of purer knowledge
of humanity, noble toleration and tender love, in the second half of the
last century.” Goethe further calls attenion to Sterne’s disclosure of
human peculiarities (Eigenheiten), and the importance and interest of
these native, governing idiosyncrasies.</p>

<p>These are, in general, superficial relationships. A&nbsp;thorough
consideration of these problems, especially as concerns the cultural
indebtedness of Goethe to the English master would be a task demanding a
separate work. Goethe was an assimilator and summed up in himself the
spirit of a century, the attitude of predecessors and
contemporaries.</p>

<p>C. F. D. Schubart wrote a poem entitled “Yorick,”<a class = "tag"
name = "tagV_76" id = "tagV_76" href = "#noteV_76">76</a> beginning</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Als Yorik starb, da flog</p>
<p>Sein Seelchen auf <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘gen’">den</ins> Himmel</p>
<p>So leicht wie ein Seufzerchen.”</p>
</div>

<p>The angels ask him for news of earth, and the greater part of the
poem is occupied with his account of human fate. The relation is quite
characteristic of Schubart in its gruesomeness, its insistence upon
all-surrounding death and dissolution; but it contains no suggestion of
Sterne’s manner, or point of view. The only explanation of association
between the poem and its title is that Schubart shared the one-sided
German estimate of Sterne’s character and hence represented him as a
sympathetic messenger bringing to heaven on his death some tidings of
human weakness.</p>

<p>In certain other manifestations, relatively subordinate, the German
literature of the latter part of the eighteenth century
<span class = "pagenum">108</span>
<a name = "page108" id = "page108"> </a>
and the beginning of the nineteenth and the life embodied therein are
different from what they would have been had it not been for Sterne’s
example. Some of these secondary fruits of the Sterne cult have been
mentioned incidentally and exemplified in the foregoing pages. It would
perhaps be conducive to definiteness to gather them here.</p>

<p>Sterne’s incontinuity of narration, the purposeful irrelation of
parts, the use of anecdote and episode, which to the stumbling reader
reduce his books to collections of disconnected essays and instances,
gave to German mediocrity a sanction to publish a mass of multifarious,
unrelated, and nondescript thought and incident. It is to be noted that
the spurious books such as the Koran, which Germany never clearly
sundered from the original, were direct examples in England of such
disjointed, patchwork books. Such a volume with a significant title is
“Mein Kontingent zur Modelectüre.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_77" id =
"tagV_77" href = "#noteV_77">77</a> Further, eccentricity in typography,
in outward form, may be largely attributed to Sterne’s influence,
although in individual cases no direct connection is traceable. Thus, to
the vagaries of Shandy is due probably the license of the author of
“Karl Blumenberg, eine tragisch-komische Geschichte,”<a class = "tag"
name = "tagV_78" id = "tagV_78" href = "#noteV_78">78</a> who fills half
pages with dashes and whole lines with “Ha!&nbsp;Ha!”</p>

<p>As has been suggested already, Sterne’s example was potent in
fostering the use of such stylistic peculiarities, as the direct appeal
to, and conversation with the reader about the work, and its progress,
and the various features of the situation. It was in use by Sterne’s
predecessors in England and by their
<span class = "pagenum">109</span>
<a name = "page109" id = "page109"> </a>
followers in Germany, before Sterne can be said to have exercised any
influence; for example, Hermes uses the device constantly in “Miss Fanny
Wilkes,” but Sterne undoubtedly contributed largely to its popularity.
One may perhaps trace to Sterne’s blank pages and similar vagaries the
eccentricity of the author of “Ueber die Moralische Schönheit und
Philosophie des Lebens,”<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_79" id = "tagV_79"
href = "#noteV_79">79</a> whose eighth chapter is titled “Vom Stolz,
eine Erzählung,” this title occupying one page; the next page (210) is
blank; the following page is adorned with an urnlike decoration beneath
which we read, “Es war einmal ein Priester.” These three pages complete
the chapter. The author of “Dorset und Julie” (Leipzig, 1773&ndash;4) is
also guilty of similar Yorickian follies.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagV_80" id = "tagV_80" href = "#noteV_80">80</a></p>

<p>Sterne’s ideas found approbation and currency apart from his general
message of the sentimental and humorous attitude toward the world and
its course. For example, the hobby-horse theory was warmly received, and
it became a permanent figure in Germany, often, and especially at first,
with playful reminder of Yorick’s use of the term.<a class = "tag" name
= "tagV_81" id = "tagV_81" href = "#noteV_81">81</a> Yorick’s
mock-scientific division of travelers seems to have met with especial
approval, and evidently became a part of conversational, and epistolary
commonplace allusion. Goethe in a letter to Marianne Willemer, November
9, 1830,<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_82" id = "tagV_82" href =
"#noteV_82">82</a> with direct reference to Sterne proposes for his son,
then traveling in Italy, the additional designation of the “bold” or
“complete” traveler. Carl August in a letter to Knebel,<a class = "tag"
name = "tagV_83" id = "tagV_83" href = "#noteV_83">83</a> dated December
26, 1785, makes quite extended allusion to the classification. Lessing
writes to Mendelssohn December 12, 1780: “The traveler whom you sent to
me a while ago was an inquisitive traveler. The one with whom I now
answer is an emigrating one.” The passage which follows is an apology
for thus adding to Yorick’s list.
<span class = "pagenum">110</span>
<a name = "page110" id = "page110"> </a>
The two travelers were respectively one Fliess and Alexander Daveson.<a
class = "tag" name = "tagV_84" id = "tagV_84" href = "#noteV_84">84</a>
Nicolai makes similar allusion to the “curious” traveler of Sterne’s
classification near the beginning of his “Beschreibung einer Reise durch
Deutschland und die Schweiz im Jahre 1781.”<a class = "tag" name =
"tagV_85" id = "tagV_85" href = "#noteV_85">85</a></p>

<p>Further search would increase the number of such allusions
indefinitely. A&nbsp;few will be mentioned in the following chapter.</p>

<p>One of Walter Shandy’s favorite contentions was the fortuitous
dependence of great events upon insignificant details. In his
philosophy, trifles were the determining factors of existence. The
adoption of this theory in Germany, as a principle in developing events
or character in fiction, is unquestionable in Wezel’s “Tobias Knaut,”
and elsewhere. The narrative, “Die Grosse Begebenheit aus kleinen
Ursachen” in the second volume of the <i>Erholungen</i>,<a class = "tag"
name = "tagV_86" id = "tagV_86" href = "#noteV_86">86</a> represents a
wholesale appropriation of the idea,&mdash;to be sure not new in Shandy,
but most strikingly exemplified there.</p>

<p>In “Sebaldus Nothanker” the Revelation of St. John is a Sterne-like
hobby-horse and is so regarded by a reviewer in the <i>Magazin der
deutschen Critik</i>.<a class = "tag" name = "tagV_87" id = "tagV_87"
href = "#noteV_87">87</a> Schottenius in Knigge’s “Reise nach
Braunschweig” rides his hobby in the shape of his fifty-seven sermons.<a
class = "tag" name = "tagV_88" id = "tagV_88" href = "#noteV_88">88</a>
Lessing uses the Steckenpferd in a letter to Mendelssohn, November 5,
1768 (Lachmann edition, XII, p.&nbsp;212), and numerous other examples
of direct or indirect allusion might be cited. Sterne’s worn-out coin
was a simile adopted and felt to be pointed.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagV_89" id = "tagV_89" href = "#noteV_89">89</a></p>

<p>Jacob Minor in a suggestive article in <i>Euphorion</i>,<a class =
"tag" name = "tagV_90" id = "tagV_90" href = "#noteV_90">90</a> entitled
“Wahrheit und Lüge auf dem Theater und in der Literatur,” expressed the
opinion that Sterne was instrumental in sharpening powers of observation
with reference to self-deception in little things, to all the deceiving
impulses of the human soul.
<span class = "pagenum">111</span>
<a name = "page111" id = "page111"> </a>
It is held that through Sterne’s inspiration Wieland and Goethe were
rendered zealous to combat false ideals and life-lies in greater things.
It is maintained that Tieck also was schooled in Sterne, and, by means
of powers of observation sharpened in this way, was enabled to portray
the conscious or unconscious life-lie.</p>

<p><a name = "noteV_2" id = "noteV_2" href = "#tagV_2">2.</a>
A further illustration may be found in the following discourse: “Von
einigen Hindernissen des akademischen Fleisses. Eine Rede bey dem
Anfange der öffentlichen Vorlesungen gehalten,” von J.&nbsp;C.
C.&nbsp;Ferber, Professor zu Helmstädt (1773,&nbsp;8<sup>o</sup>),
reviewed in <i>Magazin der deutschen Critik</i>, III, St. I., pp.
261&nbsp;ff. This academic guide of youth speaks of Sterne in the
following words: “Wie tief dringt dieser Philosoph in die verborgensten
Gänge des menschlichen Herzens, wie richtig entdeckt er die geheimsten
Federn der Handlungen, wie entlarvt, wie verabscheuungsvoll steht vor
ihm das Laster, wie liebenswürdig die Tugend! wie interessant sind seine
Schilderungen, wie eindringend seine Lehren! und woher diese grosse
Kenntniss des Menschen, woher diese getreue Bezeichnung der Natur, diese
sanften Empfindungen, die seine geistvolle Sprache hervorbringt? Dieser
Saame der Tugend, den er mit wohlthätiger Hand ausstreuet?” Yorick held
up to college or university students as a champion of virtue is
certainly an extraordinary spectacle. A&nbsp;critic in the
<i>Frankfurter Gel. Anz.</i>, August 18, 1772, in criticising the
make-up of a so-called “Landbibliothek,” recommends books “die geschickt
sind, die guten einfältigen, ungekünstelten Empfindungen reiner Seelen
zu unterhalten, einen Yorick vor allen&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” The
long article on Sterne’s character in the <i>Götting. Mag.</i>, I, pp.
84&ndash;92, 1780, “Etwas über Sterne: Schreiben an Prof. Lichtenberg”
undoubtedly helped to establish this opinion of Sterne authoritatively.
In it Sterne’s weaknesses are acknowledged, but the tendency is to
emphasize the tender, sympathetic side of his character. The conception
of Yorick there presented is quite different from the one held by
Lichtenberg himself.</p>

The story of the “Lorenzodosen” is given quite fully in Longo’s

See “Bemerkungen oder Briefe über Wien, eines jungen Bayern auf einer

the author’s “Evelina.” Also, “Meine Reise vom Städtchen

similar work, but is classed by <i>Allg. Litt. Zeitung</i> (1799, I,

Yorick. “Reisen des grünen Mannes durch Deutschland,” Halle,

Many of the anonymous books, even those popular in their day, are not
given by Goedeke; and Baker, judging only by one external, naturally
misses Sterne products which have no distinctively imitative title, and
includes others which have no connection with Sterne. For example, he
gives Gellius’s “Yoricks Nachgelassene Werke,” which is but a
translation of the Koran, and hence in no way an example of German
imitation; he gives also Schummel’s “Fritzens Reise nach Dessau” (1776)
and “Reise nach Schlesien” (1792), Nonne’s “Amors Reisen nach Fockzana
zum Friedenscongress” (1773), none of which has anything to do with
Sterne. “Trim oder der Sieg der Liebe über die Philosophie” (Leipzig,
1776), by Ludw. Ferd. v. Hopffgarten, also cited by Baker, undoubtedly
owes its name only to Sterne. See <i>Jenaische Zeitungen von gel.
Sachen</i>, 1777, p.&nbsp;67, and <i>Allg. deutsche Bibl.</i>,
XXXIV,&nbsp;2, p.&nbsp;484; similarly “Lottchens Reise ins Zuchthaus” by
Kirtsten, 1777, is given in Baker’s list, but the work “Reise” is
evidently used here only in a figurative sense, the story being but the
relation of character deterioration, a&nbsp;downward journey toward the
titular place of punishment. See <i>Jenaische Zeitungen von gel.
Sachen</i>, 1777, pp. 739&nbsp;ff.; 1778, p.&nbsp;12. <i><ins class =

XXXV,&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;182. Baker gives Bock’s “Tagereise” and
“Geschichte eines empfundenen Tages” as if they were two different
books. He further states: “Sterne is the parent of a long list of German
Sentimental Journeys which began with von Thümmel’s ‘Reise in die
mittäglichen Provinzen Frankreichs.’” This work really belongs
comparatively late in the story of imitations. Two of Knigge’s books are
also included. See p.&nbsp;166&ndash;7.</p>

“Laurence Sterne und C. M. Wieland, von Karl August Behmer, Forschungen

Erforschung fremder Einflüsse auf Wieland’s Dichtung.” To this reference
has been made. There is also another briefer study of this connection:
a&nbsp;Programm by F.&nbsp;Bauer, “Ueber den Einfluss, Laurence Sternes

1890, at Marburg, “Wieland’s Nachlass des Diogenes von Sinope und das
englische Vorbild,” a&nbsp;school “Abhandlung,” which dealt with a
connection between this work of Wieland and Sterne. Wood (“Einfluss
Fieldings auf die deutsche Litteratur,” Yokohama, 1895) finds constant
imitation of Sterne in “Don Silvio,” which, from Behmer’s proof
concerning the dates of Wieland’s acquaintance with Sterne, can hardly
be possible.</p>

Since Germany did not sharply separate the work of Sterne from his
continuator, this is, of course, to be classed from the German point of
view at that time as a borrowing from Sterne. Mager in his study depends
upon the Eugenius continuation for this and several other parallels.</p>

of Shandy as the best of Sterne’s accomplishment, as greater than the

CHAPTER VI</a><br>
&nbsp;<br>
IMITATORS OF STERNE</h3>


<p>Among the disciples of Sterne in Germany whose literary imitation may
be regarded as typical of their master’s influence, Johann Georg Jacobi
is perhaps the best known. His relation to the famous “Lorenzodosen”
conceit is sufficient to link his name with that of Yorick. Martin<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVI_1" id = "tagVI_1" href = "#noteVI_1">1</a>
asserts that he was called “Uncle Toby” in Gleim’s circle because of his
enthusiasm for Sterne. The indebtedness of Jacobi to Sterne is the
subject of a special study by Dr. Joseph Longo, “Laurence Sterne und
Johann Georg Jacobi;” and the period of Jacobi’s literary work which
falls under the spell of Yorick has also been treated in an inaugural
dissertation, “Ueber Johann Georg Jacobi’s Jugendwerke,” by Georg
Ransohoff. The detail of Jacobi’s indebtedness to Sterne is to be found
in these two works.</p>

<p>Longo was unable to settle definitely the date of Jacobi’s first
acquaintance with Sterne. The first mention made of him is in the letter
to Gleim of April 4, 1769, and a few days afterward,&mdash;April
10,&mdash;the intelligence is afforded that he himself is working on a
“journey.” The “Winterreise” was published at Düsseldorf in the middle
of June, 1769. Externally the work seems more under the influence of the
French wanderer Chapelle, since prose and verse are used irregularly
alternating, a&nbsp;style quite different from the English model. There
are short and unnumbered chapters, as in the Sentimental Journey, but,
unlike Sterne, Jacobi, with one exception, names no places and makes no
attempt at description of place or people, other than the sentimental
individuals encountered on the way. He makes no analysis of national, or
even local characteristics: the journey, in short, is almost completely
without place-influence.
<span class = "pagenum">113</span>
<a name = "page113" id = "page113"> </a>
There is in the volume much more exuberance of fancy, grotesque at
times, a&nbsp;more conscious exercise of the picturing imagination than
we find in Sterne. There is use, too, of mythological figures quite
foreign to Sterne, an obvious reminiscence of Jacobi’s Anacreontic
experience. He exaggerates Yorick’s sentimentalism, is more weepy, more
tender, more sympathizing; yet, as Longo does not sufficiently
emphasize, he does not touch the whimsical side of Yorick’s work.
Jacobi, unlike his model, but in common with other German imitators, is
insistent in instruction and serious in contention for pet theories, as
is exemplified by the discussion of the doctrine of immortality. There
are opinions to be maintained, there is a message to be delivered.
Jacobi in this does not give the lie to his nationality.</p>

<p>Like other German imitators, too, he took up with especial feeling
the relations between man and the animal world, an attitude to be
connected with several familiar episodes in Sterne.<a class = "tag" name
= "tagVI_2" id = "tagVI_2" href = "#noteVI_2">2</a> The two chapters,
“Der Heerd” and “Der Taubenschlag,” tell of a sentimental farmer who
mourns over the fact that his son has cut down a tree in which the
nightingale was wont to nest. A&nbsp;similar sentimental regard is
cherished in this family for the doves, which no one killed, because no
one could eat them. Even as Yorick meets a Franciscan, Jacobi encounters
a Jesuit whose heart leaps to meet his own, and later, after the real
journey is done, a&nbsp;visit to a lonely cloister gives opportunity for
converse with a monk, like Pater Lorenzo,&mdash;tender, simple and
humane.</p>

<p>The “Sommerreise,” according to Longo, appeared in the latter part of
September, 1769, a&nbsp;less important work, which, in the edition of
1807, Jacobi considered unworthy of preservation. Imitation of Sterne is
marked: following a criticism by Wieland the author attempts to be
humorous, but with dubious success; he introduces a Sterne-like
sentimental character which had not been used in the “Winterreise,”
a&nbsp;beggar-soldier,
<span class = "pagenum">114</span>
<a name = "page114" id = "page114"> </a>
and he repeats the motif of human sympathy for animals in the story of
the lamb. Sympathy with erring womanhood is expressed in the incidents
related in “Die Fischerhütte” and “Der Geistliche.” These two books were
confessedly inspired by Yorick, and contemporary criticism treated them
as Yorick products. The <i>Deutsche Bibliothek der schönen
Wissenschaften</i>, published by Jacobi’s friend Klotz, would naturally
favor the volumes. Its review of the “Winterreise” is non-critical and
chiefly remarkable for the denial of foreign imitation. The
<i>Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek</i>,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_3"
id = "tagVI_3" href = "#noteVI_3">3</a> in reviewing the same work pays
a significant tribute to Sterne, praising his power of disclosing the
good and beautiful in the seemingly commonplace. In direct criticism of
the book, the reviewer calls it a journey of fancy, the work of a
youthful poet rather than that of a sensitive philosopher. Wieland is
credited with the astounding opinion that he prefers the “Sommerreise”
to Yorick’s journey.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_4" id = "tagVI_4"
href = "#noteVI_4">4</a> Longo’s characterization of Sterne is in the
main satisfactory, yet there is distinctly traceable the tendency to
ignore or minimize the whimsical elements of Sterne’s work: this is the
natural result of his approach to Sterne, through Jacobi, who understood
only the sentimentalism of the English master.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVI_5" id = "tagVI_5" href = "#noteVI_5">5</a></p>

<p>Among the works of sentiment which were acknowledged imitations of
Yorick, along with Jacobi’s “Winterreise,” probably the most typical and
best known was the “Empfindsame Reisen durch Deutschland” by Johann
Gottlieb Schummel. Its importance as a document in the history of
sentimentalism is rather as an example of tendency than as a force
contributing materially to the spread of the movement. Its influence was
<span class = "pagenum">115</span>
<a name = "page115" id = "page115"> </a>
probably not great, though one reviewer does hint at a following.<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVI_6" id = "tagVI_6" href = "#noteVI_6">6</a>
Yet the book has been remembered more persistently than any other work
of its genre, except Jacobi’s works, undoubtedly in part because it was
superior to many of its kind, partly, also, because its author won later
and maintained a position of some eminence, as a writer and a pedagogue;
but largely because Goethe’s well-known review of it in the
<i>Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen</i> has been cited as a remarkably
acute contribution to the discriminating criticism of the genuine and
the affected in the eighteenth-century literature of feeling, and has
drawn attention from the very fact of its source to the object of its
criticism.</p>

<p>Schummel was born in May, 1748, and hence was but twenty years of age
when Germany began to thrill in response to Yorick’s sentiments. It is
probable that the first volume was written while Schummel was still a
university student in 1768&ndash;1770. He assumed a position as teacher
in 1771, but the first volume came out at Easter of that year; this
would probably throw its composition back into the year before. The
second volume appeared at Michaelmas of the same year. His publisher was
Zimmermann at Wittenberg and Zerbst, and the first volume at any rate
was issued in a new edition. The third volume came out in the spring of
1772.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_7" id = "tagVI_7" href =
"#noteVI_7">7</a> Schummel’s title, “Empfindsame Reisen,” is, of course,
taken from the newly coined word in Bode’s title, but in face of this
fact it is rather remarkable to find that several quotations from
Sterne’s Journey, given in the course of the work, are from the
Mittelstedt translation. On two occasions, indeed, Schummel uses the
title of the Mittelstedt rendering as first published, “Versuch über die
menschliche Natur.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_8" id = "tagVI_8" href
= "#noteVI_8">8</a></p>

<p>These facts lead one to believe that Schummel drew his inspiration
from the reading of this translation. This is interesting in connection
with Böttiger’s claim that the whole cavalcade of sentimental travelers
who trotted along after Yorick with all sorts of animals and vehicles
was a proof of the excellence and power of Bode’s translation. As one
would naturally
<span class = "pagenum">116</span>
<a name = "page116" id = "page116"> </a>
infer from the title of Schummel’s fiction, the Sentimental Journey is
more constantly drawn upon as a source of ideas, motifs, expression, and
method, than Tristram Shandy, but the allusions to Sterne’s earlier
book, and the direct adaptations from it are both numerous and generous.
This fact has not been recognized by the critics, and is not an easy
inference from the contemporary reviews.</p>

<p>The book is the result of an immediate impulse to imitation felt
irresistibly on the reading of Sterne’s narrative. That the critics and
readers of that day treated with serious consideration the efforts of a
callow youth of twenty or twenty-one in this direction is indicative
either of comparative vigor of execution, or of prepossession of the
critical world in favor of the literary genre,&mdash;doubtless of both.
Schummel confesses that the desire to write came directly after the book
had been read. “I&nbsp;had just finished reading it,” he says, “and
Heaven knows with what pleasure, every word from ‘as far as this matter
is concerned’ on to ‘I seized the hand of the lady’s maid,’ were
imprinted in my soul with small invisible letters.” The characters of
the Journey stood “life-size in his very soul.” Involuntarily his
inventive powers had sketched several plans for a continuation,
releasing Yorick from the hand of the <i>fille de chambre</i>. But what
he attempts is not a continuation but a German parallel.</p>

<p>In the outward events of his story, in the general trend of its
argument, Schummel does not depend upon either Shandy or the Journey:
the hero’s circumstances are in general not traceable to the English
model, but, spasmodically, the manner of narration and the nature of the
incidents are quite slavishly copied. A&nbsp;complete summary of the
thread of incident on which the various sentimental adventures,
whimsical speculations and digressions are hung, can be dispensed with:
it is only necessary to note instances where connection with Sterne as a
model can be established. Schummel’s narrative is often for many
successive pages absolutely straightforward and simple, unbroken by any
attempt at Shandean buoyancy, and unblemished by overwrought sentiment.
At the pausing places he generally indulges in Sternesque quibbling.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">117</span>
<a name = "page117" id = "page117"> </a>
<p>A brief analysis of the first volume, with especial reference to the
appropriation of Yorick features, will serve to show the extent of
imitation, and the nature of the method. In outward form the Sentimental
Journey is copied. The volume is not divided into chapters, but there
are named divisions: there is also Yorick-like repetition of
section-headings. Naturally the author attempts at the very beginning to
strike a note distinctly suggesting Sterne: “Is he dead, the old
cousin?” are the first words of the volume, uttered by the hero on
receipt of the news, and in Yorick fashion he calls for guesses
concerning the mien with which the words were said. The conversation of
the various human passions with Yorick concerning the advisability of
offering the lady in Calais a seat in his chaise is here directly
imitated in the questions put by avarice, vanity, etc., concerning the
cousin’s death. The actual journey does not begin until page 97,
a&nbsp;brief autobiography of the hero occupying the first part of the
book; this inconsequence is confessedly intended to be a Tristram Shandy
whim.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_9" id = "tagVI_9" href =
"#noteVI_9">9</a> The author’s relation to his parents is adapted
directly from Shandy, since he here possesses an incapable, unpractical,
philosophizing father, who determines upon methods for the superior
education of his son; and a simple, silly mockery of a mother.</p>

<p>Left, however, an orphan, he begins his sentimental adventures:
thrust on the world he falls in with a kindly baker’s wife whose conduct
toward him brings tears to the eyes of the ten-year old lad, this
showing his early appetite for sentimental journeying. A&nbsp;large part
of this first section relating to his early life and youthful struggles,
his kindly benefactor, his adventure with Potiphar’s wife, is simple and
direct, with only an occasional hint of Yorick’s influence in word or
phrase, as if the author, now and then, recalled the purpose and the
inspiration. For example, not until near the bottom of page 30 does it
occur to him to be abrupt and indulge in Shandean eccentricities, and
then again, after a few lines, he resumes the natural order of
discourse. And again, on page 83, he breaks off into attempted frivolity
and Yorick whimsicality
<span class = "pagenum">118</span>
<a name = "page118" id = "page118"> </a>
of narration. In starting out upon his journey the author says:
“I&nbsp;will tread in Yorick’s foot-prints, what matters it if I do not
fill them out? My heart is not so broad as his, the sooner can it be
filled; my head is not so sound; my brain not so regularly formed. My
eyes are not so clear, but for that he was born in England and I in
Germany; he is a man and I am but a youth, in short, he is Yorick and I
am not Yorick.” He determines to journey where it is most sentimental
and passes the various lands in review in making his decision. Having
fastened upon Germany, he questions himself similarly with reference to
the cities. Yorick’s love of lists, of mock-serious discrimination, of
inconsequential reasonings is here copied. The call upon epic, tragic,
lyric poets, musicians, etc., which follows here is a further imitation
of Yorick’s list-making and pseudo-scientific method.</p>

<p>On his way to Leipzig, in the post-chaise, the author falls in with a
clergyman: the manner of this meeting is intended to be Sterne-like:
Schummel sighs, the companion remarks, “You too are an unhappy one,” and
they join hands while the human heart beams in the traveler’s eyes. They
weep too at parting. But, apart from these external incidents of their
meeting, the matter of their converse is in no way inspired by Sterne.
It joins itself with the narrative of the author’s visit to a church in
a village by the wayside, and deals in general with the nature of the
clergyman’s relation to his people and the general mediocrity and
ineptitude of the average homiletical discourse, the failure of
clergymen to relate their pulpit utterance to the life of the common
Christian,&mdash;all of which is genuine, sane and original, undoubtedly
a real protest on the part of Schummel, the pedagogue, against a
prevailing abuse of his time and other times. This section represents
unquestionably the earnest convictions of its author, and is written
with professional zeal. This division is followed by an evidently
purposeful return to Sterne’s eccentricity of manner. The author begins
a division of his narrative, “Der zerbrochene Postwagen,” which is
probably meant to coincide with the post-chaise accident in Shandy’s
travels, writes a few lines in it, then begins the section again,
something like the interrupted
<span class = "pagenum">119</span>
<a name = "page119" id = "page119"> </a>
story of the King of Bohemia and his Seven Castles. Then follows an
abrupt discursive study of his aptitudes and proclivities, interspersed
with Latin exclamations, interrogation points and dashes. “What a
parenthesis is that!” he cries, and a few lines further on, “I&nbsp;burn
with longing to begin a parenthesis again.” On his arrival in Leipzig,
Schummel imitates closely Sterne’s satirical guide-book description of
Calais<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_10" id = "tagVI_10" href =
"#noteVI_10">10</a> in his brief account of the city, breaking off
abruptly like Sterne, and roundly berating all “Reisebeschreiber.” Here
in fitting contrast with this superficial enumeration of facts stands
his brief traveler’s creed, an interest in people rather than in places,
all of which is derived from Sterne’s chapter, “In the Street, Calais,”
in which the master discloses the sentimental possibilities of traveling
and typifies the superficial, unemotional wanderer in the persons of
Smelfungus and Mundungus, and from the familiar passage in “The
Passport, Versailles,” beginning, “But I could wish to spy out the
nakedness, etc.” No sooner is he arrived in Leipzig, than he
accomplishes a sentimental rescue of an unfortunate woman on the street.
In the expression of her immediate needs, Schummel indulges for the
first time in a row of stars, with the obvious intention of raising a
low suggestion, which he contradicts with mock-innocent questionings a
few lines later, thereby fastening the attention on the possibility of
vulgar interpretation. Sterne is guilty of this device in numerous
instances in both his works, and the English continuation of the
Sentimental Journey relies upon it in greater and more revolting
measure.</p>

<p>Once established in his hotel, the author betakes himself to the
theater: this very act he feels will bring upon him the censure of the
critics, for Yorick went to the theater too. “A&nbsp;merchant’s boy went
along before me,” he says in naïve defense, “was he also an imitator of
Yorick?” On the way he meets a fair maid-in-waiting, and the relation
between her and the traveler, developed here and later, is inspired
directly by Yorick’s connection with the fair <i>fille de chambre</i>.
Schummel imitates Sterne’s excessive detail of description, devoting a
<span class = "pagenum">120</span>
<a name = "page120" id = "page120"> </a>
whole paragraph to his manner of removing his hat before a lady whom he
encounters on this walk to the theater. This was another phase of
Sterne’s pseudo-scientific method: he describes the trivial with the
attitude of the trained observer, registering minutely the detail of
phenomena, a&nbsp;mock-parade of scholarship illustrated by his
description of Trim’s attitude while reading his sermon, or the dropping
of the hat in the kitchen during the memorable scene when the news of
Bobby’s death is brought.</p>

<p>In Schummel’s narration of his adventures in the house of ill-repute
there are numerous sentimental excrescences in his conduct with the poor
prisoner there, due largely to Yorick’s pattern, such as their weeping
on one another’s breast, and his wiping away her tears and his, drawn
from Yorick’s amiable service for Maria of Moulines, an act seemingly
expressing the most refined human sympathy. The remaining events of this
first volume include an unexpected meeting with the kind baker’s wife,
which takes place at Gellert’s grave. Yorick’s imitators were especially
fond of re-introducing a sentimental <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘relationiship’">relationship</ins>. Yorick led the way in
his renewed acquaintance with the <i>fille de chambre</i>; Stevenson in
his continuation went to extremes in exploiting this cheap device.</p>

<p>Other motifs derived from Sterne, less integral, may be briefly
summarized. From the Sentimental Journey is taken the motif that
valuable or interesting papers be used to wrap ordinary articles of
trade: here herring are wrapped in fragments of the father’s philosophy;
in the Sentimental Journey we find a similar degrading use for the
“Fragment.” Schummel breaks off the chapter “La Naïve,”<a class = "tag"
name = "tagVI_11" id = "tagVI_11" href = "#noteVI_11">11</a> under the
Sternesque subterfuge of having to deliver manuscript to an insistent
publisher. Yorick writes his preface to the Journey in the
“Désobligeant,” that is, in the midst of the narrative itself. Schummel
modifies the eccentricity merely by placing his foreword at the end of
the volume. The value of it, he says, will repay the reader for waiting
so long,&mdash;a&nbsp;statement which finds little justification in the
preface itself. It begins, “Auweh!
<span class = "pagenum">121</span>
<a name = "page121" id = "page121"> </a>
Auweh! Ouais, Helas! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Diable, mein Rücken, mein Fuss!”
and so on for half a page,&mdash;a&nbsp;pitiful effort to follow the
English master’s wilful and skilful incoherence. The following pages,
however, once this outbreak is at an end, contain a modicum of sense,
the feeble, apologetic explanation of his desire in imitating Yorick,
given in forethought of the critics’ condemnation. Similarly the
position of the dedication is unusual, in the midst of the volume, even
as the dedication of Shandy was roguishly delayed. The dedication
itself, however, is not an imitation of Sterne’s clever satire, but,
addressed to Yorick himself, is a striking example of burning personal
devotion and over-wrought praise. Schummel hopes<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVI_12" id = "tagVI_12" href = "#noteVI_12">12</a> in Sterne fashion
to write a chapter on “Vorübergeben,” or in the chapter “Das
Komödienhaus” (pp. 185&ndash;210) to write a digression on “Walking
behind a maid.” Like Sterne, he writes in praise of digressions.<a class
= "tag" name = "tagVI_13" id = "tagVI_13" href = "#noteVI_13">13</a> In
imitation of Sterne is conceived the digressive speculation concerning
the door through which at the beginning of the book he is cast into the
rude world. Among further expressions savoring of Sterne, may be
mentioned a “Centner of curses” (p.&nbsp;39), a&nbsp;“Quentchen of
curses,” and the analytical description of a tone of voice as one-fourth
questioning, five-eighths entreating and one-eighth commanding
(p.&nbsp;229).</p>

<p>The direct allusions to Sterne and his works are numerous.
A&nbsp;list of Sterne characters which were indelibly impressed upon his
mind is found near the very beginning (pp.&nbsp;3&ndash;4); other
allusions are to M.&nbsp;Dessein (p.&nbsp;65), La Fleur’s
“Courierstiefel” (p.&nbsp;115), the words of the dying Yorick
(p.&nbsp;128), the pococurantism of Mrs. Shandy (p.&nbsp;187), the
division of travelers into types (p.&nbsp;141), Uncle Toby
(p.&nbsp;200), Yorick’s violin-playing (p.&nbsp;274), the foolish fat
scullion (p.&nbsp;290), Yorick’s description of a maid’s (p.&nbsp;188)
eyes, “als ob sie zwischen vier Wänden einem Garaus machen könnten.”</p>

<p>The second volume is even more incoherent in narration, and contains
less genuine occurrence and more ill-considered attempts at
whimsicality, yet throughout this volume there are
<span class = "pagenum">122</span>
<a name = "page122" id = "page122"> </a>
indications that the author is awakening to the vulnerability of his
position, and this is in no other particular more easily discernible
than in the half-hearted defiance of the critics and his anticipation of
their censure. The change, so extraordinary in the third volume, is
foreshadowed in the second. Purely sentimental, effusive, and abundantly
teary is the story of the rescued baker’s wife. In this excess of
sentiment, Schummel shows his intellectual appreciation of Sterne’s
individual treatment of the humane and pathetic, for near the end of the
poor woman’s narrative the author seems to recollect a fundamental
sentence of Sterne’s creed, the inevitable admixture of the whimsical,
and here he introduces into the sentimental relation a Shandean
idiosyncrasy: from page 43 the narrative leaps back to the beginning of
the volume, and Schummel advises the reader to turn back and re-read,
referring incidentally to his confused fashion of narration. The
awkwardness with which this is done proves Schummel’s inability to
follow Yorick, though its use shows his appreciation of Sterne’s
peculiar genius. The visit of the author, the baker’s wife and her
daughter (the former lady’s maid) to the graveyard is Yorickian in
flavor, and the plucking of nettles from the grave of the dead epileptic
is a direct borrowing. Attempts to be immorally, sensuously suggestive
in the manner of Sterne are found in the so-called chapter on
“Button-holes,” here cast in a more Shandean vein, and in the adventure
“die ängstliche Nacht,”&mdash;in the latter case resembling more the
less frank, more insinuating method of the Sentimental Journey. The
sentimental attitude toward man’s dumb companions is imitated in his
adventure with the house-dog; the author fears the barking of this
animal may disturb the sleep of the poor baker’s wife: he beats the dog
into silence, then grows remorseful and wishes “that I had given him no
blow,” or that the dog might at least give him back the blows. His
thought that the dog might be pretending its pain, he designates a
subtle subterfuge of his troubled conscience, and Goethe, in the review
mentioned above, exclaims, “A&nbsp;fine pendant to Yorick’s scene with
the Monk.”</p>

<p>Distinctly Shandean are the numerous digressions, as on imitation
<span class = "pagenum">123</span>
<a name = "page123" id = "page123"> </a>
(p.&nbsp;16), on authors and fairs (p.&nbsp;45), that which he calls
(pp. 226&ndash;238) “ein ganz originelles Gemische von Wiz, Belesenheit,
Scharfsinn, gesunder Philosophie, Erfahrung, Algebra und Mechanik,” or
(p.&nbsp;253) “Von der Entstehungsart eines Buches nach Erfindung der
<ins class = "correction" title = "variant spelling">Buchdrukerkunst</ins>,”
which in reference to Sterne’s phrase,
is called a “jungfräuliche Materie.” He promises (pp. 75 and 108), like
Sterne, to write numerous chapters on extraordinary
subjects,&mdash;indeed, he announces his intention of supplementing the
missing sections of Shandy on “Button-holes” and on the “Right and Left
(sic) end of a Woman.” His own promised effusions are to be “Ueber die
roten und schwarzen <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘Röke,’ without close quote">Röcke,”</ins>,
“über die Verbindung der Theologie mit Schwarz,”
“Europäischen&shy;frauenzimmer&shy;schuhabsätze,” <!-- gesundheit -->
half a one “Ueber die Schuhsohlen” and “Ueber meinen Namen.”</p>

<p>His additions to Shandy are flat and witless, that on the “Right and
Wrong End of a Woman” (pp. 88&nbsp;ff.) degenerating into three brief
narratives displaying woman’s susceptibility to flattery, the whole idea
probably adapted from Sterne’s chapter, “An Act of Charity;” the chapter
on “Button-holes” is made a part of the general narrative of his
relation to his “Naïve.” Weakly whimsical is his seeking pardon for the
discourse with which the Frenchman (pp. 62&ndash;66), under the pretext
that it belonged somewhere else and had inadvertently crept in. Shandean
also is the black margin to pages 199&ndash;206, the line upside down
(p.&nbsp;175), the <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘twleve’">twelve</ins>
irregularly printed lines (p.&nbsp;331), inserted
to indicate his efforts in writing with a burned hand, the lines of
dashes and exclamation points, the mathematical, financial calculation
of the worth of his book from various points of view, and the
description of the maiden’s walk (p.&nbsp;291). Sterne’s mock-scientific
method, as already noted, is observable again in the statement of the
position of the dagger “at an angle of 30°” (p.&nbsp;248). His coining
of new words, for which he is censured by the <i>Allgemeine deutsche
Bibliothek</i>, is also a legacy of Yorick’s method.</p>

<p>The third volume bears little relation to Sterne aside from its
title, and one can only wonder, in view of the criticism of the two
parts already published and the nature of the author’s own
<span class = "pagenum">124</span>
<a name = "page124" id = "page124"> </a>
partial revulsion of feeling, that he did not give up publishing it
altogether, or choose another title, and sunder the work entirely from
the foregoing volumes, with which it has in fact so contradictory a
connection. It may be that his relations to the publisher demanded the
issuing of the third part under the same title.</p>

<p>This volume is easily divisible into several distinct parts, which
are linked with one another, and to the preceding narrative, only by a conventional thread of
<ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘inroduction’">introduction</ins>.
These comprise: the story of Caroline
and Rosenfeld, a&nbsp;typical eighteenth century tale of love, seduction
and flight; the hosts’ ballad, “Es war einmahl ein Edelmann;” the play,
“Die unschuldige Ehebrecherin” and “Mein Tagebuch,” the journal of an
honest preacher, and a further sincere exploitation of Schummel’s ideas
upon the clergyman’s office, his ideal of simplicity, kindliness, and
humanity. In the latter part of the book Schummel resumes his original
narrative, and indulges once more in the luxury of sentimental
adventure, but without the former abortive attempts at imitating
Sterne’s peculiarities of diction. This last resumption of the
sentimental creed introduces to us one event evidently inspired by
Yorick: he meets a poor, maimed soldier-beggar. Since misfortune has
deprived the narrator himself of his possessions, he can give nothing
and goes a begging for the beggar’s sake, introducing the new and highly
sentimental idea of “vicarious begging” (pp. 268&ndash;9). In the
following episode, a&nbsp;visit to a child-murderess, Schummel leaves a
page entirely blank as an appropriate proof of <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘incaapcity’">incapacity</ins> to express his
emotions attendant on the execution of the unfortunate. Sterne also left
a page blank for the description of the Widow Wadman’s charms.</p>

<p>At the very end of the book Schummel drops his narrative altogether
and discourses upon his own work. It would be difficult to find in any
literature so complete a condemnation of one’s own serious and extensive
endeavor, so candid a criticism of one’s own work, so frank an
acknowledgment of the pettiness of one’s achievement. He says his work,
as an imitation of Sterne’s two novels, has “few or absolutely no
beauties of the original, and many faults
<span class = "pagenum">125</span>
<a name = "page125" id = "page125"> </a>
of its own.” He states that his enthusiasm for Tristram has been
somewhat dampened by Sonnenfels and Riedel; he sees now faults which
should not have been imitated; the frivolous attitude of the narrator
toward his father and mother is deprecated, and the suggestion is given
that this feature was derived from Tristram’s own frankness concerning
the eccentricities and incapacities of his parents. He begs reference to
a passage in the second volume<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_14" id =
"tagVI_14" href = "#noteVI_14">14</a> where the author alludes with
warmth of appreciation to his real father and mother; that is, genuine
regard overcame the temporary blindness, real affection arose and thrust
out the transitory inclination to an alien whimsicality.</p>

<p>Schummel admits that he has utterly failed in his effort to
characterize the German people in the way Sterne treated the English and
French; he confesses that the ninety-page autobiography which precedes
the journey itself was intended to be Tristram-like, but openly
stigmatizes his own failure as “ill conceived, incoherent and not very
well told!” After mentioning some few incidents and passages in this
first section which he regards as passable, he boldly condemns the rest
as “almost beneath all criticism,” and the same words are used with
reference to much that follows, in which he confesses to imitation, bad
taste and intolerable indelicacy. He calls his pathetic attempts at
whimsical mannerisms (Heideldum, etc.), “kläglich, überaus kläglich,”
expresses the opinion that one would not be surprised at the reader who
would throw away the whole book at such a passage. The words of the
preacher in the two sections where he is allowed to air his opinions
still meet with his approval, and the same is true of one or two other
sections. In conclusion, he states that the first part contains hardly
one hundred good pages, and that the second part is worse than the
first, so that he is unwilling to look at it again and seek out its
faults. The absence of allusions to Sterne’s writings is marked, except
in the critical section at the end, he mentions Sterne but once
(p.&nbsp;239), where he calls him “schnurrigt.” This alteration of
feeling must have taken place in a brief space of time, for the third
volume is signed
<span class = "pagenum">126</span>
<a name = "page126" id = "page126"> </a>
April 25, 1772. It is not easy to establish with probability the works
of Sonnenfels and Riedel which are credited with a share in this
revulsion of feeling.</p>

<p>In all of this Schummel is a discriminating critic of his own work;
he is also discerning in his assertion that the narrative contained in
his volume is conceived more in the vein of Fielding and Richardson. The
Sterne elements are rather embroidered on to the other fabric, or, as he
himself says, using another figure, “only fried in Shandy fat.”<a class
= "tag" name = "tagVI_15" id = "tagVI_15" href = "#noteVI_15">15</a></p>

<p>Goethe’s criticism of the second volume, already alluded to, is found
in the <i>Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen</i> in the issue of March 3,
1772. The nature of the review is familiar: Goethe calls the book a
thistle which he has found on Yorick’s grave. “Alles,” he says, “hat es
dem guten Yorick geraubt, Speer, Helm und Lanze, nur Schade! inwendig
steckt der Herr Präceptor S. zu Magdeburg .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yorick
empfand, und dieser setzt sich hin zu empfinden. Yorick wird von seiner
Laune ergriffen, und weinte und lachte in einer Minute und durch die
Magie der Sympathie lachen und weinen wir mit: hier aber steht einer und
überlegt: wie lache und weine ich? was werden die Leute sagen, wenn ich
lache und weine?” etc. Schummel is stigmatized as a childish imitator
and his book is censured as “beneath criticism,” oddly enough the very
judgment its own author accords but a few weeks later on the completion
of the third volume. The review contains several citations illustrative
of Schummel’s style.</p>

<p>The first two parts were reviewed in the <i>Allgemeine deutsche
Bibliothek</i>.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_16" id = "tagVI_16" href =
"#noteVI_16">16</a> The length of the review is testimony to the
interest in the book, and the tone of the article, though frankly
unfavorable, is not so emphatically censorious as the one first noted.
It is observed that Schummel has attempted the impossible,&mdash;the
adoption of another’s “Laune,” and hence his failure. The reviewer
notes, often with generous quotations, the more noticeable, direct
imitations from Sterne, the conversation of the emotions, the
nettle-plucking at the grave, the eccentric orthography and the
new-coined words. Several passages of
<span class = "pagenum">127</span>
<a name = "page127" id = "page127"> </a>
comment or comparison testify to the then current admiration of Yorick,
and the conventional German interpretation of his character; “sein
gutes, empfindungsvolles Herz, mit Tugend und sittlichem Gefühl
erfüllt.” The review is signed “Sr:”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_17"
id = "tagVI_17" href = "#noteVI_17">17</a></p>

<p>A critic in the <i>Jenaische Zeitungen von gelehrten Sachen</i> for
January 17, 1772, treating the first two volumes, expresses the opinion
that Jacobi, the author of the “Tagereise,” and Schummel have little but
the title from Yorick. The author’s seeking for opportunity to dissolve
in emotion is contrasted unfavorably with Yorick’s method, the affected
style is condemned, yet it is admitted that the work promises better
things from its talented author; his power of observation and his good
heart are not to be unacknowledged. The severity of the review is
directed against the imitators already arising.</p>

<p>The <i>Magazin der deutschen Critik</i><a class = "tag" name =
"tagVI_18" id = "tagVI_18" href = "#noteVI_18">18</a> reviews the third
volume with favorable comment; the comedy which Schummel saw fit to
insert is received with rather extraordinary praise, and the author is
urged to continue work in the drama; a&nbsp;desire is expressed even for
a fourth part. The <i>Hamburgische Neue Zeitung</i>, June 4 and October
29, 1771, places Schummel unhesitatingly beside the English master,
calls him as original as his pattern, to Sterne belongs the honor only
of the invention. The author is hailed as a genius whose talents should
be supported, so that Germany would not have to envy England her
Yorick.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_19" id = "tagVI_19" href =
"#noteVI_19">19</a></p>

<p>After Schummel’s remarkable self-chastisement, one could hardly
expect to find in his subsequent works evidence of Sterne’s influence,
save as unconsciously a dimmed admiration might exert a certain force.
Probably contemporaneous with the composition of the third volume of the
work, but possibly earlier, Schummel wrote the fourth part of a
ponderous novel by a fellow Silesian, Christian Opitz, entitled “Die
Gleichheit der menschlichen Herzen, bey der Ungleichheit ihrer
äusserlichen Umstände in der Geschichte Herrn Redlichs
<span class = "pagenum">128</span>
<a name = "page128" id = "page128"> </a>
und seiner Bedienten.” Goedeke implies that Opitz was the author of all
but the last part, but the reviewer in the <i>Allgemeine deutsche
Bibliothek</i><a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_20" id = "tagVI_20" href =
"#noteVI_20">20</a> maintains that each part has a different author, and
quotes the preface to the fourth as substantiation. According to this
review both the second and fourth parts are characterized by a humorous
fashion in writing, and the last is praised as being the best of the
four. It seems probable that Schummel’s enthusiasm for Sterne played its
part in the composition of this work.</p>

<p>Possibly encouraged by the critic’s approbation, Schummel devoted his
literary effort for the following years largely to the drama. In 1774 he
published his “Uebersetzer-Bibliothek zum Gebrauche der Uebersetzer,
Schulmänner und Liebhaber der alten Litteratur.” The reviewer<a class =
"tag" name = "tagVI_21" id = "tagVI_21" href = "#noteVI_21">21</a> in
the <i>Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek</i> finds passages in this book in
which the author of the “Empfindsame Reisen” is visible,&mdash;where his
fancy runs away with his reason,&mdash;and a passage is quoted in which
reference is made to Slawkenberg’s book on noses. It would seem that the
seeking for wit survived the crude sentimentality.</p>

<p>Two years later Schummel published “Fritzen’s Reise nach Dessau,”<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVI_22" id = "tagVI_22" href =
"#noteVI_22">22</a> a&nbsp;work composed of letters from a twelve-year
old boy, written on a journey from Magdeburg to Dessau. The letters are
quite without whim or sentiment, and the book has been remembered for
the extended description of Basedow’s experimental school,
“Philantropin” (opened in 1774). Its account has been the source of the
information given of this endeavor in some pedagogical treatises<a class
= "tag" name = "tagVI_23" id = "tagVI_23" href = "#noteVI_23">23</a> and
it was re-issued, as a document in the history of pedagogical
experiment, in Leipzig, by Albert Richter in 1891. About fifteen years
later still the “Reise durch
<span class = "pagenum">129</span>
<a name = "page129" id = "page129"> </a>
Schlesien”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_24" id = "tagVI_24" href =
"#noteVI_24">24</a> was issued. It is a simple narrative of a real
journey with description of places and people, frankly personal, almost
epistolary in form, without a suggestion of Sterne-like whim or
sentiment. One passage is significant as indicating the author’s
realization of his change of attitude. The sight of a group of prisoners
bound by a chain calls to his memory his former sentimental
extravagance, and he exclaims: “Twenty years ago, when I was still a
sentimental traveler, I&nbsp;would have wasted many an ‘Oh’ and ‘alas’
over this scene; at present, since I have learned to know the world and
mankind somewhat more intimately, I&nbsp;think otherwise.”</p>

<p>Johann Christian Bock (1724&ndash;1785), who was in 1772 theater-poet
of the Ackerman Company in Hamburg, soon after the publication of the
Sentimental Journey, identified himself with the would-be Yoricks by the
production of “Die Tagereise,” which was published at Leipzig in 1770.
The work was re-issued in 1775 with the new title “Die Geschichte eines
empfundenen Tages.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_25" id = "tagVI_25"
href = "#noteVI_25">25</a> The only change in the new edition was the
addition of a number of copperplate engravings. The book is inspired in
part by Sterne directly, and in part indirectly through the intermediary
Jacobi. Unlike the work of Schummel just treated, it betrays no Shandean
influence, but is dependent solely on the Sentimental Journey. In
outward form the book resembles Jacobi’s “Winterreise,” since verse is
introduced to vary the prose narrative. The attitude of the author
toward his journey, undertaken with conscious purpose, is characteristic
of the whole set of emotional sentiment-seekers, who found in their
Yorick a challenge to go and do likewise: “Everybody is journeying,
I&nbsp;thought, and took Yorick and Jacobi with me. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I&nbsp;will really see whether I too may not chance upon a <i>fille de
chambre</i> or a harvest-maid,” is a very significant statement of his
inspiration and intention. Once started on his journey, the author falls
in with a poor warrior-beggar, an adaptation of Sterne’s Chevalier de
St. Louis,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_26" id = "tagVI_26" href =
"#noteVI_26">26</a> and he puts in
<span class = "pagenum">130</span>
<a name = "page130" id = "page130"> </a>
verse Yorick’s expressed sentiment that the king and the fatherland
should not allow the faithful soldier to fall into such distress.</p>

<p>Bock’s next sentimental adventure is with a fair peasant-maid whom he
sees weeping by the wayside. Through Yorick-like insistence of sympathy,
he finally wins from her information concerning the tender situation:
a&nbsp;stern stepfather, an unwelcome suitor of his choosing, and a
lover of her own. Her inability to write and thus communicate with the
latter is the immediate cause of the present overflow. The traveler
beholds in this predicament a remarkable sentimental opportunity and
offers his services; he strokes her cheek, her tears are dried, and they
part like brother and sister. The episode is unquestionably inspired by
the episode of Maria of Moulines; in the latter development of the
affair, the sentiment, which is expressed, that the girl’s innocence is
her own defense is borrowed directly from Yorick’s statement concerning
the <i>fille de chambre</i>.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_27" id =
"tagVI_27" href = "#noteVI_27">27</a> The traveler’s questioning of his
own motives in “Die Ueberlegung”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_28" id =
"tagVI_28" href = "#noteVI_28">28</a> is distinctly Sterne-like, and it
demonstrates also Bock’s appreciation of this quizzical element in
Yorick’s attitude toward his own sentimental behavior. The relation of
man to the domestic animals is treated sentimentally in the episode of
the old beggar and his dead dog:<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_29" id =
"tagVI_29" href = "#noteVI_29">29</a> the tears of the beggar, his
affection for the beast, their genuine comradeship, and the dog’s
devotion after the world had forsaken his master, are all part and
parcel of that fantastic humane movement which has its source in
Yorick’s dead ass. Bock practically confesses his inspiration by direct
allusion to the episode in Yorick. Bock defends with warmth the old
peasant and his grief.</p>

<p>The wanderer’s acquaintance with the lady’s companion<a class = "tag"
name = "tagVI_30" id = "tagVI_30" href = "#noteVI_30">30</a> is adapted
from Yorick’s <i>fille de chambre</i> connection, and Bock cannot avoid
a fleshly suggestion, distinctly in the style of Yorick in the section,
the “Spider.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_31" id = "tagVI_31" href =
"#noteVI_31">31</a> The return journey in
<span class = "pagenum">131</span>
<a name = "page131" id = "page131"> </a>
the sentimental moonlight affords the author another opportunity for the
exercise of his broad human sympathy: he meets a poor woman,
a&nbsp;day-laborer with her child, gives them a few coins and doubts
whether king or bishop could be more content with the benediction of the
apostolic chair than he with the blessing of this
unfortunate,&mdash;a&nbsp;sentiment derived from Yorick’s overcolored
veneration for the horn snuff-box.</p>

<p>The churchyard scene with which the journey ends is more openly
fanciful, down-right visionary in tone, but the manner is very
emphatically not that of Sterne, though in the midst the Sterne motif of
nettle-plucking is introduced. This sentimental episode took hold of
German imagination with peculiar force. The hobby-horse idea also was
sure of its appeal, and Bock did not fail to fall under its spell.<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVI_32" id = "tagVI_32" href =
"#noteVI_32">32</a></p>

<p>But apart from the general impulse and borrowing of motif from the
foreign novel, there is in this little volume considerable that is
genuine and original: the author’s German patriotism, his praise of the
old days in the Fatherland in the chapter entitled “Die Gaststube,” his
“Trinklied eines Deutschen,” his disquisition on the position of the
poet in the world (“ein eignes Kapitel”), and his adulation of Gellert
at the latter’s grave. The reviewer in the <i>Deutsche Bibliothek der
schönen Wissenschaften</i><a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_33" id =
"tagVI_33" href = "#noteVI_33">33</a> chides the unnamed, youthful
author for not allowing his undeniable talents to ripen to maturity, for
being led on by Jacobi’s success to hasten his exercises into print. In
reality Bock was no longer youthful (forty-six) when the “Tagereise” was
published. The <i>Almanach der deutschen Musen</i> for 1771, calls the
book “an unsuccessful imitation of Yorick and Jacobi,” and wishes that
this “Rhapsodie von Cruditäten” might be the last one thrust on the
market as a “Sentimental Journey.” The <i>Allgemeine deutsche
Bibliothek</i><a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_34" id = "tagVI_34" href =
"#noteVI_34">34</a> comments also on the double inspiration, and the
insufficiency and tiresomeness of the performance. And yet Boie<a class
= "tag" name = "tagVI_35" id = "tagVI_35" href = "#noteVI_35">35</a>
says the papers praised the little book; for himself, however, he
<span class = "pagenum">132</span>
<a name = "page132" id = "page132"> </a>
observes, he little desires to read it, and adds “What will our Yoricks
yet come to? At last they will get pretty insignificant, I&nbsp;think,
if they keep on this way.”</p>

<p>Bock was also the author of a series of little volumes written in the
early seventies, still under the sentimental charm: (1)&nbsp;Empfindsame
Reise durch die Visitenzimmer am Neujahrstag von einem deutschen Yorick
angestellt, Cosmopolis (Hamburg) 1771&mdash;really published at the end
of the previous year; (2)&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;am Ostertage, 1772;
(3)&nbsp;Am Pfingsttage, 1772; (4)&nbsp;Am Johannistage, 1773;
(5)&nbsp;Am Weynachtstage, 1773. These books were issued anonymously,
and Schröder’s Lexicon gives only (2) and (3) under Bock’s name, but
there seems no good reason to doubt his authorship of them all. Indeed,
his claim to (1) is, according to the <i>Frankfurter Gelehrte
Anzeigen</i>, well-nigh proven by an allusion to the “Tagereise” in the
introduction, and by the initials signed. None of them are given by
Goedeke. The books are evidently only in a general way dependent on the
Sterne model, and are composed of observations upon all sorts of
subjects, the first section of each volume bearing some relation to the
festival in which they appear.</p>

<p>In the second edition of the first volume the author confesses that
the title only is derived from Yorick,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_36"
id = "tagVI_36" href = "#noteVI_36">36</a> and states that he was forced
to this misuse because no one at that time cared to read anything but
“Empfindsame Reisen.” It is also to be noted that the description
beneath the title, “von einem deutschen Yorick angestellt,” is omitted
after the first volume. The review of (4) and (5) in the <i>Altonaer
Reichs-Postreuter</i> finds this a commendable resumption of proper
humility. The observations are evidently loosely strung together without
the pretense of a narrative, such as “Allgemeines Perspectiv durch alle
Visitenzimmer, Empfindsamer Neujahrswunsch, Empfindsame Berechnung eines
Weisen mit sich selbst, Empfindsame Entschlüsse, Empfindsame Art sein
Geld gut unterzubringen,” etc.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_37" id =
"tagVI_37" href = "#noteVI_37">37</a> An obvious purpose inspires the
writer, the furthering of morality and virtue; many of the
<span class = "pagenum">133</span>
<a name = "page133" id = "page133"> </a>
meditations are distinctly religious. That some of the observations had
a local significance in Hamburg, together with the strong sentimental
tendency there, may account for the warm reception by the
<i>Hamburgischer unpartheyischer Correspondent</i>.<a class = "tag" name

<p>Some contemporary critics maintained a kinship between Matthias
Claudius and Yorick-Sterne, though nothing further than a similarity of
mental and emotional fibre is suggested. No one claimed an influence
working from the English master. Even as late as 1872, Wilhelm Röseler
in his introductory poem to a study of “Matthias Claudius und sein
Humor”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_39" id = "tagVI_39" href =
"#noteVI_39">39</a> calls Asmus, “Deutschland’s Yorick,” thereby
agreeing almost verbally with the German correspondent of the
<i>Deutsches Museum</i>, who wrote from London nearly a hundred years
before, September 14, 1778, “Asmus .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is the German
Sterne,” an assertion which was denied by a later correspondent, who
asserts that Claudius’s manner is very different from that of Sterne.<a

"#noteVI_40">40</a></p>

<p>August von Kotzebue, as youthful narrator, betrays a dependence on
Sterne in his strange and ingeniously contrived tale, “Die Geschichte
meines Vaters, oder wie es zuging, dass ich gebohren wurde.”<a class =
"tag" name = "tagVI_41" id = "tagVI_41" href = "#noteVI_41">41</a> The
influence of Sterne is noticeable in the beginning of the story: he
commences with a circumstantial account of his grandfather and
grandmother, and the circumstances of his father’s birth. The
grandfather is an original undoubtedly modeled on lines suggested by
Sterne’s hobby-horse idea. He had been chosen in days gone by to greet
the reigning prince on the latter’s return from a journey, and the old
man harks back to this circumstance with “hobby-horsical” persistence,
whatever the subject of conversation,
<span class = "pagenum">134</span>
<a name = "page134" id = "page134"> </a>
even as all matters led Uncle Toby to military fortification, and the
elder Shandy to one of his pet theories.</p>

<p>In Schrimps the servant, another Shandean original is designed. When
the news comes of the birth of a son on Mount Vesuvius, master and man
discuss <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘mutifarious’">multifarious</ins>
and irrelevant topics in a fashion
reminiscent of the conversation downstairs in the Shandy mansion while
similar events are going on above. Later in the book we have long lists,
or catalogues of things which resemble one of Sterne’s favorite
mannerisms. But the greater part of the wild, adventurous tale is far
removed from its inception, which presented domestic whimsicality in a
gallery of originals, unmistakably connected with Tristram Shandy.</p>

<p>Göschen’s “Reise von Johann”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_42" id =
"tagVI_42" href = "#noteVI_42">42</a> is a product of the late
renascence of sentimental journeying. Master and servant are represented
in this book as traveling through southern Germany, a&nbsp;pair as
closely related in head and heart as Yorick and La Fleur, or Captain
Shandy and Corporal Trim. The style is of rather forced buoyancy and
sprightliness, with intentional inconsequence and confusion, an attempt
at humor of narration, which is choked by characteristic national desire
to convey information, and a fatal propensity to description of
places,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_43" id = "tagVI_43" href =
"#noteVI_43">43</a> even when some satirical purpose underlies the
account, as in the description of Erlangen and its university. The
servant Johann has mild adventures with the maids in the various inns,
which are reminiscent of Yorick, and in one case it borders on the
openly suggestive and more Shandean method.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVI_44" id = "tagVI_44" href = "#noteVI_44">44</a> A&nbsp;distinctly
borrowed motif is the accidental finding of papers which contain matters
of interest. This is twice resorted to; a&nbsp;former occupant of the
room in the inn in Nürnberg had left valuable notes of travel; and
Johann, meeting a ragged woman, bent on self-destruction, takes from her
a box with papers, disclosing a revolting story, baldly told. German
mediocrity, imitating Yorick in this regard, and failing of his delicacy
and subtlety, brought forth hideous offspring. An
<span class = "pagenum">135</span>
<a name = "page135" id = "page135"> </a>
attempt at whimsicality of style is apparent in the “Furth Catechismus
in Frage und Antwort” (pp. 71&ndash;74), and genuinely sentimental
adventures are supplied by the death-bed scene (pp. 70&ndash;71) and the
village funeral (pp. 74&ndash;77).</p>

<p>This book is classed by Ebeling<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_45" id
= "tagVI_45" href = "#noteVI_45">45</a> without sufficient reason as an
imitation of von Thümmel. This statement is probably derived from the
letter from Schiller to Goethe to which Ebeling refers in the following
lines. Schiller is writing to Goethe concerning plans for the Xenien,
December 29, 1795.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_46" id = "tagVI_46"
href = "#noteVI_46">46</a> The abundance of material for the Xenien
project is commented upon with enthusiastic anticipation, and in a list
of vulnerable possibilities we read: “Thümmel, Göschen als sein
Stallmeister&mdash;” a&nbsp;collocation of names easily attributable, in
consideration of the underlying satiric purpose, to the general nature
of their work, without in any way implying the dependence of one author
on another,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_47" id = "tagVI_47" href =
"#noteVI_47">47</a> or it could be interpreted as an allusion to the
fact that Göschen was von Thümmel’s publisher. Nor is there anything in
the correspondence to justify Ebeling’s harshness in saying concerning
this volume of Göschen, that it “enjoyed the honor of being ridiculed
(verhöhnt) in the Xenien-correspondence between Goethe and Schiller.”
Goethe replies (December 30), in approval, and <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘exlaims’">exclaims</ins>, “How fine Charis and
Johann will appear beside one another.”<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVI_48" id = "tagVI_48" href = "#noteVI_48">48</a> The suggestion
concerning a possible use of Göschen’s book in the Xenien was never
carried out.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Göschen submitted the manuscript of his
book to Schiller, and that Schiller returned the same with the statement
“that he had laughed heartily at some of the whims<ins class =

Although it is not a sentimental journey, as Schummel and Jacobi and
Bock conceived it, and is thus not an example of the earliest period of
imitation, and although it contains no passages of teary sentimentality
in attitude toward man and beast, one must hesitate in denying all
connection with Sterne’s manner. It would seem as if, having outgrown
the earlier Yorick, awakened from dubious, fine-spun dreams of human
brotherhood, perhaps by the rude clatter of the French revolution,
certain would-be men of letters turned to Yorick again and saw, as
through a glass darkly, that other element of his nature, and tried in
lumbering, Teutonic way to adopt his whimsicality, shorn now of
sentimentalism, and to build success for their wares on remembrance of a
defaced idol. This view of later sentimental journeying is practically
acknowledged at any rate in a contemporary review, the <i>Allgemeine
Litteratur-Zeitung</i> for August 22, 1796, which remarks:
“A&nbsp;sentimental voyage ist ein Quodlibet, wo einige bekannte Sachen
und Namen gezwungenen Wiz und matten Scherz heben sollen.”<a class =
"tag" name = "tagVI_53" id = "tagVI_53" href = "#noteVI_53">53</a></p>

<p>Hedemann’s book is conspicuous in its effort to be whimsical and is
openly satirical in regard to the sentimentalism of former travelers.
His endeavor is markedly in Sterne’s manner in his attitude toward the
writing of the book, his conversation about the difficulty of managing
the material, his discussion with himself and the reader about the
various parts of the book. Quite in Sterne’s fashion, and to be
associated with Sterne’s frequent promises of chapters, and statements
concerning embarrassment of material, is conceived his determination “to
mention some things beforehand about which I don’t know anything to
say,” and his rather humorous enumeration
<span class = "pagenum">137</span>
<a name = "page137" id = "page137"> </a>
of them. The author satirizes the real sentimental traveler of Sterne’s
earlier imitators in the following passage (second chapter):</p>

<p>“It really must be a great misfortune, an exceedingly vexatious case,
if no sentimental scenes occur to a sentimental traveler, but this is
surely not the case; only the subjects, which offer themselves must be
managed with strict economy. If one leaps over the most interesting
events entirely, one is in danger, indeed, of losing everything, at
least of not filling many pages.”</p>

<p>Likewise in the following account of a sentimental adventure, the
satirical purpose is evident. He has not gone far on his journey when he
is met by a troop of children; with unsentimental coldness he determines
that there is a “Schlagbaum” in the way. After the children have opened
the barrier, he debates with himself to which child to give his little
coin, concludes, as a “sentimental traveler,” to give it to the other
sex, then there is nothing left to do but to follow his instinct. He
reflects long with himself whether he was right in so doing,&mdash;all
of which is a deliberate jest at the hesitation with reference to
trivial acts, the self-examination with regard to the minutiae of past
conduct, which was copied by Sterne’s imitators from numerous instances
in the works of Yorick. Satirical also is his vision in Chapter VII, in
which he beholds the temple of stupidity where lofty stupidity sits on a
paper throne; and of particular significance here is the explanation
that the whole company who do “erhabene Dummheit” honor formerly lived
in cities of the kingdom, but “now they are on journeys.” Further
examples of a humorous manner akin to Sterne are: his statement that it
would be a “great error” to write an account of a journey without
weaving in an anecdote of a prince, his claim that he has fulfilled all
duties of such a traveler save to fall in love, his resolve to
accomplish it, and his formal declaration: “I, the undersigned, do vow
and make promise to be in love before twenty-four hours are past.” The
story with which his volume closes, “Das Ständchen,” is rather
entertaining and is told graphically, easily, without
<span class = "pagenum">138</span>
<a name = "page138" id = "page138"> </a>
whim or satire, yet not without a Sternian <i>double entendre</i>.<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVI_54" id = "tagVI_54" href =
"#noteVI_54">54</a></p>

<p>Another work in which sentimentalism has dwindled away to a grinning
shade, and a certain irresponsible, light-hearted attitude is the sole
remaining connection with the great progenitor, is probably the
“Empfindsame Reise nach Schilda” (Leipzig, 1793), by Andreas Geo. Fr.
von Rabenau, which is reviewed in the <i>Allgemeine
Litteratur-Zeitung</i> (1794, I, p.&nbsp;416) as a free revision of an
old popular tale, “Das lustige und lächerliche Lalenburg.” The book is
evidently without sentimental tinge, is a merry combination of wit and
joke combined with caricature and half-serious tilting against
unimportant literary celebrities.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_55" id =
"tagVI_55" href = "#noteVI_55">55</a></p>

<p>Certain miscellaneous works, which are more or less obviously
connected with Sterne may be grouped together here.</p>

<p>To the first outburst of Sterne enthusiasm belongs an anonymous
product, “Zween Tage eines Schwindsüchtigen, etwas Empfindsames,” von
L.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. (Hamburg, 1772), yet the editor admits that the
sentiment is “not entirely like Yorick’s,” and the <i>Altonaer
Reichs-Postreuter</i> (July 2, 1772) adds that “not at all like
Yorick’s” would have been nearer the truth. This book is mentioned by
Hillebrand with implication that it is the extreme example of the absurd
sentimental tendency, probably judging merely from the title,<a class =
"tag" name = "tagVI_56" id = "tagVI_56" href = "#noteVI_56">56</a> for
the book is doubtless merely thoughtful, contemplative, with a minimum
of overwrought feeling.</p>

<p>According to the <i>Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen</i> (1775, pp.
592&ndash;3), another product of the earlier seventies, the “Leben und
Schicksale des Martin Dickius,” by Johann Moritz Schwager, is in many
places a clever imitation of Sterne,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_57"
id = "tagVI_57" href = "#noteVI_57">57</a> although the author claims,
like Wezel in “Tobias Knaut,” not to have read Shandy until after the
book was written. Surely
<span class = "pagenum">139</span>
<a name = "page139" id = "page139"> </a>
the digression on noses which the author allows himself is
suspicious.</p>

<p>Blankenburg, the author of the treatise on the novel to which
reference has been made, was regarded by contemporary and subsequent
criticism as an imitator of Sterne in his oddly titled novel “Beyträge
zur Geschichte des teutschen Reiches und teutscher Sitten,”<a class =
"tag" name = "tagVI_58" id = "tagVI_58" href = "#noteVI_58">58</a>
although the general tenor of his essay, in reasonableness and balance,
seemed to promise a more independent, a&nbsp;more competent and
felicitous performance. Kurz expresses this opinion, which may have been
derived from criticisms in the eighteenth century journals. The
<i>Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen</i>, July 28, 1775, does not, however,
take this view; but seems to be in the novel a genuine exemplification
of the author’s theories as previously expressed.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVI_59" id = "tagVI_59" href = "#noteVI_59">59</a> The <i>Allgemeine
deutsche Bibliothek</i><a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_60" id =
"tagVI_60" href = "#noteVI_60">60</a> calls the book didactic,
a&nbsp;tract against certain essentially German follies. Merck, in the
<i>Teutscher Merkur</i>,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_61" id =
"tagVI_61" href = "#noteVI_61">61</a> says the imitation of Sterne is
quite too obvious, though Blankenburg denies&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Among miscellaneous and anonymous works inspired directly by Sterne,
belongs undoubtedly “Die Geschichte meiner Reise nach Pirmont” (1773),
the author of which claims that it was written before Yorick was
translated or Jacobi published. He says he is not worthy to pack
Yorick’s bag or weave Jacobi’s arbor,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_62"
id = "tagVI_62" href = "#noteVI_62">62</a> but the review of the
<i>Almanach der deutschen Musen</i> evidently regards it as a product,
nevertheless, of Yorick’s impulse. Kuno Ridderhoff in his study of Frau
la Roche<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_63" id = "tagVI_63" href =
"#noteVI_63">63</a> says that the “Empfindsamkeit” of Rosalie in the
first part of “Rosaliens Briefe” is derived from Yorick. The “Leben,
Thaten und Meynungen des D.&nbsp;J. Pet. Menadie” (Halle,
1777&ndash;1781) is charged by the <i>Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek</i>
with attempt at Shandy-like eccentricity of narrative and love of
digression.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_64" id = "tagVI_64" href =
"#noteVI_64">64</a></p>

<span class = "pagenum">140</span>
<a name = "page140" id = "page140"> </a>
<p>One little volume, unmistakably produced under Yorick’s spell, is
worthy of particular mention because at its time it received from the
reviewers a more cordial welcome than was accorded to the rank and file
of Sentimental Journeys. It is “M&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
R&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” by E.&nbsp;A. A. von Göchhausen
(1740&ndash;1824), which was published at Eisenach, 1772, and was deemed
worthy of several later editions. Its dependence on Sterne is confessed
and obvious, sometimes apologetically and hesitatingly, sometimes
defiantly. The imitation of Sterne is strongest at the beginning, both
in outward form and subject-matter, and this measure of indebtedness
dwindles away steadily as the book advances. Göchhausen, as other
imitators, used at the outset a modish form, returned to it consciously
now and then when once under way, but when he actually had something to
say, a&nbsp;message of his own, found it impracticable or else forgot to
follow his model.</p>

<p>The absurd title stands, of course, for “Meine Reisen” and the
puerile abbreviation as well as the reasons assigned for it, were
intended to be a Sterne-like jest, a&nbsp;pitiful one. Why Goedeke
should suggest “Meine Randglossen” is quite inexplicable, since
Göchhausen himself in the very first chapter indicates the real title.
Beneath the enigmatical title stands an alleged quotation from Shandy:
“Ein Autor borgt, bettelt und stiehlt so stark von dem andern, dass bey
meiner Seele! die Originalität fast so rar geworden ist als die
Ehrlichkeit.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_65" id = "tagVI_65" href =
"#noteVI_65">65</a> The book itself, like Sterne’s Journey, is divided
into brief chapters unnumbered but named. As the author loses Yorick
from sight, the chapters grow longer. Göchhausen has availed himself of
an odd device to disarm criticism,&mdash;a&nbsp;plan used once or twice
by Schummel: occasionally when the imitation is obvious, he repudiates
the charge sarcastically, or anticipates with irony the critics’
censure. For example, he gives directions to his servant Pumper to pack
for the journey; a&nbsp;reader exclaims, “a&nbsp;portmanteau, Mr.
Author, so that everything, even to that, shall be just like Yorick,”
and in the following passage the author quarrels with the critics who
allow no one to travel with a portmanteau, because an English
<span class = "pagenum">141</span>
<a name = "page141" id = "page141"> </a>
clergyman traveled with one. Pumper’s misunderstanding of this objection
is used as a farther ridicule of the critics. When on the journey, the
author converses with two poor wandering monks, whose conversation, at
any rate, is a witness to their content, the whole being a legacy of the
Lorenzo episode, and the author entitles the chapter: “The members of
the religious order, or, as some critics will call it, a&nbsp;wretchedly
unsuccessful imitation.” In the next chapter, “Der Visitator” (pp.
125&nbsp;ff.) in which the author encounters customs annoyances, the
critic is again allowed to complain that everything is stolen from
Yorick, a&nbsp;protest which is answered by the author quite naïvely,
“Yorick journeyed, ate, drank; I&nbsp;do too.” In “Die Pause” the author
stands before the inn door and fancies that a number of spies
(Ausspäher) stand there waiting for him; he protests that Yorick
encountered beggars before the inn in Montreuil, a&nbsp;very different
sort of folk. On page 253 he exclaims, “<ins class = "correction" title
= "text reads ‘fur’">für</ins> diesen schreibe ich dieses Kapitel nicht
und ich&mdash;beklage ihn!” Here a footnote suggests “Das übrige des
Diebstahls vid. Yorick’s Gefangenen.” Similarly when he calls his
servant his “La Fleur,” he converses with the critics about his theft
from Yorick.</p>

<p>The book is opened by a would-be whimsical note, the guessing about
the name of the book. The dependence upon Sterne, suggested by the
motto, is clinched by reference to this quotation in the section
“Apologie,” and by the following chapter, which is entitled “Yorick.”
The latter is the most unequivocal and, withal, the most successful
imitation of Yorick’s manner which the volume offers. The author is
sitting on a sofa reading the Sentimental Journey, and the idea of such
a trip is awakened in him. Someone knocks and the door is opened by the
postman, as the narrator is opening his “Lorenzodose,” and the story of
the poor monk is touching his heart now for the twentieth time as
strongly as ever. The postman asks postage on the letter as well as his
own trivial fee. The author counts over money, miscounts it, then in
counting forgets all about it, puts the money away and continues the
reading of Yorick. The postman interrupts him; the author grows
impatient and says, “You want four groschen?” and is inexplicably
<span class = "pagenum">142</span>
<a name = "page142" id = "page142"> </a>
vexed at the honesty of the man who says it is only three pfennigs for
himself and the four groschen for the post. Here is a direct following
of the Lorenzo episode; caprice rules his behavior toward an inferior,
who is modest in his request. After the incident, his spite, his head
and his heart and his “ich” converse in true Sterne fashion as to the
advisability of his beginning to read Yorick again. He reasons with
himself concerning his conduct toward the postman, then in an apostrophe
to Yorick he condemns himself for failing in this little test. This
conversation occupies so much time that he cannot run after the postman,
but he resolves that nothing, not even the fly that lights on his nose,
shall bring him so far as to forget wherefore his friend
J&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sent him a “Lorenzodose.” And at the end
of the section there is a picture of the snuff-box with the lid open,
disclosing the letters of the word “Yorick.” The “Lorenzodose” is
mentioned later, and later still the author calms his indignation by
opening the box; he fortifies himself also by a look at the treasure.<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVI_66" id = "tagVI_66" href =
"#noteVI_66">66</a></p>

<p>Following this picture of the snuff-box is an open letter to “My dear
J&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;,” who, at the author’s request, had sent
him on June 29th a “Lorenzodose.” Jacobi’s accompanying words are given.
The author acknowledges the difficulty with which sometimes the
self-conquest demanded by allegiance to the sentimental symbol has been
won.</p>

<p>Yet, compared with some other imitations of the good Yorick, the
volume contains but a moderate amount of lavish sentiment. The servant
Pumper is a man of feeling, who grieves that the horses trod the
dewdrops from the blades of grass. Cast in the real Yorick mould is the
scene in which Pumper kills a marmot (Hamster); upon his master’s
expostulation that God created the little beast also, Pumper is touched,
wipes the blood off with his cuff and buries the animal with tenderness,
indulging in a pathetic soliloquy; the whole being a variant of Yorick’s
ass episode.</p>

<p>Marked with a similar vein of sentimentality is the narrator’s
conduct toward the poor wanderer with his heavy burden: the author
asserts that he has never eaten a roll, put on
<span class = "pagenum">143</span>
<a name = "page143" id = "page143"> </a>
a&nbsp;white shirt, traveled in a comfortable carriage, or been borne by
a strong horse, without bemoaning those who were less fortunately
circumstanced. A&nbsp;similar and truly Sterne-like triumph of feeling
over convention is the traveler’s insistence that Pumper shall ride with
him inside the coach; seemingly a point derived from Jacobi’s failure to
be equally democratic.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_67" id = "tagVI_67"
href = "#noteVI_67">67</a></p>

<p>Sterne’s emphasis upon the machinery of his story-telling, especially
his distraught pretense at logical sequence in the ordering of his
material is here imitated. For example: near the close of a chapter the
author summons his servant Pumper, but since the chapter bore the title
“Der Brief” and the servant can neither read nor write a letter, he says
the latter has nothing to do in that chapter, but he is to be introduced
in the following one. Yet with Yorick’s inconsequence, the narrator is
led aside and exclaims at the end of this chapter, “But where is
Pumper?” with the answer, “Heaven and my readers know, it was to no
purpose that this chapter was so named (and perhaps this is not the last
one to which the title will be just as appropriate)”, and the next
chapter pursues the whimsical attempt, beginning “As to whether Pumper
will appear in this chapter, about that, dear reader, I&nbsp;am not
really sure myself.”</p>

<p>The whimsical, unconventional interposition of the reader, and the
author’s reasoning with him, a&nbsp;Sterne device, is employed so
constantly in the book as to become a wearying mannerism. Examples have
already been cited, additional ones are numerous: the fifth section is
devoted to such conversation with the reader concerning the work; later
the reader objects to the narrator’s drinking coffee without giving a
chapter about it; the reader is allowed to express his wonder as to what
the chapter is going to be because of the author’s leap; the reader
guesses where the author can be, when he begins to describe conditions
in the moon. The chapter “Der Einwurf” is occupied entirely with the
reader’s protest, and the last two sections are largely the record of
fancied conversations with various readers concerning the nature of the
book; here the author discloses himself.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVI_68" id = "tagVI_68" href = "#noteVI_68">68</a> Sterne-like whim
is found in the
<span class = "pagenum">144</span>
<a name = "page144" id = "page144"> </a>
chapter “Die Nacht,” which consists of a single sentence: “Ich schenke
Ihnen diesen ganzen Zeitraum, denn ich habe ihn ruhig verschlafen.”
Similar Shandean eccentricity is illustrated by the chapter entitled
“Der Monolog,” which consists of four lines of dots, and the question,
“Didn’t you think all this too, my readers?” Typographical eccentricity
is observed also in the arrangement of the conversation of the ladies
A., B., C., D., etc., in the last chapter. Like Sterne, our author makes
lists of things; probably inspired by Yorick’s apostrophe to the
“Sensorium” is our traveler’s appeal to the spring of joy. The
description of the fashion of walking observed in the maid in the moon
is reminiscent of a similar passage in Schummel’s journey.</p>

<p>Göchhausen’s own work, untrammeled by outside influence, is
considerable, largely a genial satire on critics and philosophers; his
stay in the moon is a kind of Utopian fancy.</p>

<p>The literary journals accepted Göchhausen’s work as a Yorick
imitation, condemned it as such apologetically, but found much in the
book worthy of their praise.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_69" id =
"tagVI_69" href = "#noteVI_69">69</a></p>

<p>Probably the best known novel which adopts in considerable measure
the style of Tristram Shandy is Wezel’s once famous “Tobias Knaut,” the
“Lebensgeschichte Tobias Knauts des Weisen sonst Stammler genannt, aus
Familiennachrichten gesammelt.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_70" id =
"tagVI_70" href = "#noteVI_70">70</a> In this work the influence of
Fielding is felt parallel to that of Sterne. The historians of
literature all accord the book a high place among humorous efforts of
the period, crediting the author with wit, narrative ability, knowledge
of human nature and full consciousness of plan and purpose.<a class =
"tag" name = "tagVI_71" id = "tagVI_71" href = "#noteVI_71">71</a> They
unite also in the opinion that “Tobias Knaut” places Wezel in the ranks
of Sterne imitators, but this can be accepted only guardedly, for in
part the novel must be regarded as a satire on “Empfindsamkeit” and
hence in some measure be classified as an opposing force to Sterne’s
dominion,
<span class = "pagenum">145</span>
<a name = "page145" id = "page145"> </a>
especially to the distinctively German Sterne. That this impulse, which
later became the guiding principle of “Wilhelmine Arend,” was already
strong in “Tobias Knaut” is hinted at by Gervinus, but passed over in
silence by other writers. Kurz, following Wieland, who reviewed the
novel in his <i>Merkur</i>, finds that the influence of Sterne was
baneful. Other contemporary reviews deplored the imitation as obscuring
and stultifying the undeniable and genuinely original talents of the
author.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_72" id = "tagVI_72" href =
"#noteVI_72">72</a></p>

<p>A brief investigation of Wezel’s novel will easily demonstrate his
indebtedness to Sterne. Yet Wezel in his preface, anticipating the
charge of imitation, asserts that he had not read Shandy when “Tobias”
was begun. Possibly he intends this assertion as a whim, for he quotes
Tristram at some length.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_73" id =
"tagVI_73" href = "#noteVI_73">73</a> This inconsistency is occasion for
censure on the part of the reviewers.</p>

<p>Wezel’s story begins, like Shandy, “ab ovo,” and, in resemblance to
Sterne’s masterpiece, the connection between the condition of the child
before its birth and its subsequent life and character is insisted upon.
A&nbsp;reference is later made to this. The work is episodical and
digressive, but in a more extensive way than Shandy; the episodes in
Sterne’s novel are yet part and parcel of the story, infused with the
personality of the writer, and linked indissolubly to the little family
of originals whose sayings and doings are immortalized by Sterne. This
is not true of Wezel: his episodes and digressions are much more purely
extraneous in event, and nature of interest. The story of the new-found
son, which fills sixty-four pages, is like a story within a story, for
its connection with the Knaut family is very remote. This very story,
interpolated as it is, is itself again interrupted by a seven-page
digression concerning Tyrus, Alexander, Pipin and Charlemagne, which the
author states is taken from the one hundred and twenty-first chapter of
his “Lateinische Pneumatologie,”&mdash;a&nbsp;genuine Sternian pretense,
reminding one of the “Tristrapaedia.” Whimsicality of manner distinctly
reminiscent
<span class = "pagenum">146</span>
<a name = "page146" id = "page146"> </a>
of Sterne is found in his mock-scientific catalogues or lists of things,
as in Chapter III, “Deduktionen, Dissertationen, Argumentationen a
priori und a posteriori,” and so on; plainly adapted from Sterne’s
idiosyncrasy of form is the advertisement which in large red letters
occupies the middle of a page in the twenty-first chapter of the second
volume, which reads as follows: “Dienst-freundliche Anzeige. Jedermann,
der an ernsten Gesprächen keinen Gefallen findet, wird freundschaftlich
ersucht alle folgende Blätter, deren Inhalt einem Gespräche ähnlich
sieht, wohlbedächtig zu überschlagen, d.h. von dieser Anzeige an
gerechnet. Darauf denke ich, soll jedermanniglich <ins class =
"correction" title = "superfluous .">vom.</ins> 22<ins class =
"correction" title = "extra space, as for a sentence break">.&nbsp;</ins>Absatze
fahren können,&mdash;Cuique Suum.” The
following page is blank: this is closely akin to Sterne’s vagaries. Like
Sterne, he makes promise of chapter-subject.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVI_74" id = "tagVI_74" href = "#noteVI_74">74</a> Similarly
dependent on Sterne’s example, is the Fragment in Chapter VIII, Volume
III, which breaks off suddenly under the plea that the rest could not be
found. Like Sterne, our author satirizes detailed description in the
excessive account of the infinitesimals of personal discomfort after a
carouse.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_75" id = "tagVI_75" href = "#noteVI_75">75</a>
He makes also obscure whimsical allusions, accompanied by
<ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘typograhical’">typographical</ins>
eccentricities (I, p.&nbsp;153). To
be connected with the story of the Abbess of Andouillets is the humor
“Man leuterirte, appelirte&mdash;irte,&mdash;irte,&mdash;irte.”</p>

<p>The author’s perplexities in managing the composition of the book are
sketched in a way undoubtedly derived from Sterne,&mdash;for example,
the beginning of Chapter IX in Volume III is a lament over the
difficulties of chronicling what has happened during the preceding
learned disquisition. When Tobias in anger begins to beat his horse,
this is accompanied by the sighs of the author, a&nbsp;really audible
one being put in a footnote, the whole forming a whimsy of narrative
style for which Sterne must be held responsible. Similar to this is the
author’s statement (Chap. XXV, Vol. II), that Lucian, Swift, Pope,
Wieland and all the rest could not unite the characteristics which had
just been predicated of Selmann. Like Sterne, Wezel converses with the
reader about
<span class = "pagenum">147</span>
<a name = "page147" id = "page147"> </a>
the way of telling the story, indulging<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVI_76" id = "tagVI_76" href = "#noteVI_76">76</a> in a mock-serious
line of reasoning with meaningless Sternesque dashes. Further
conversation with the reader is found at the beginning of Chapter III in
Volume I, and in Chapter VIII of the first volume, he cries, “Wake up,
ladies and gentlemen,” and continues at some length a conversation with
these fancied personages about the progress of the book. Wezel in a few
cases adopted the worst feature of Sterne’s work and was guilty of bad
taste in precisely Yorick’s style: Tobias’s adventure with the so-called
soldier’s wife, after he has run away from home, is a case in point, but
the following adventure with the two maidens while Tobias is bathing in
the pool is distinctly suggestive of Fielding. Sterne’s indecent
suggestion is also followed in the hints at the possible occasion of the
Original’s aversion to women. A&nbsp;similar censure could be spoken
regarding the adventure in the tavern,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_77"
id = "tagVI_77" href = "#noteVI_77">77</a> where the author hesitates on
the edge of grossness.</p>

<p>Wezel joined other imitators of Yorick in using as a motif the
accidental interest of lost documents, or papers: here the poems of the
“Original,” left behind in the hotel, played their rôle in the tale. The
treatment of the wandering boy by the kindly peasant is clearly an
imitation of Yorick’s famous visit in the rural cottage. A&nbsp;parallel
to Walter Shandy’s theory of the dependence of great events on trifles
is found in the story of the volume of Tacitus, which by chance
suggested the sleeping potion for Frau v. L., or that Tobias’s inability
to take off his hat with his right hand was influential on the boy’s
future life. This is a reminder of Tristram’s obliquity in his manner of
setting up his top. As in Shandy, there is a discussion about the
location of the soul. The character of Selmann is a compound of Yorick
and the elder Shandy, with a tinge of satiric exaggeration, meant to
chastise the thirst for “originals” and overwrought sentimentalism. His
generosity and sensitiveness to human pain is like Yorick. As a boy he
would empty his purse into the bosom of a poor man; but his daily life
was one round of Shandean speculation, largely
<span class = "pagenum">148</span>
<a name = "page148" id = "page148"> </a>
about the <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘relationiships’">relationships</ins>
of trivial things: for example, his yearly periods of investigating
his motives in inviting his neighbors Herr v.
<ins class = "correction" title = "asterisks unchanged">**</ins>
and Herr v.
<ins class = "correction" title = "asterisks unchanged">***</ins>
every July to his home.</p>

<p>Wezel’s satire on the craze for originality is exemplified in the
account of the “Original” (Chap. XXII, Vol. II), who was cold when
others were hot, complained of not liking his soup because the plate was
not full, but who threw the contents of his coffee cup at the host
because it was filled to the brim, and trembled at the approach of a
woman. Selmann longs to meet such an original. Selmann also thinks he
has found an original in the inn-keeper who answers everything with
“Nein,” greatly to his own disadvantage, though it turns out later that
this was only a device planned by another character to gain advantage
over Selmann himself. So also, in the third volume, Selmann and Tobias
ride off in pursuit of a sentimental adventure, but the latter proves to
be merely a jest of the Captain at the expense of his sentimental
friend. Satire on sentimentalism is further unmistakable in the two
maidens, Adelheid and Kunigunde, who weep over a dead butterfly, and
write a lament over its demise. In jest, too, it is said that the
Captain made a “sentimental journey through the stables.” The author
converses with Ermindus, who seems to be a kind of Eugenius,
a&nbsp;convenient figure for reference, apostrophe, and appeal. The
novelist makes also, like Sterne, mock-pedantic allusions, once indeed
making a long citation from a learned Chinese book. An expression
suggesting Sterne is the oath taken “bey den Nachthemden aller Musen,”<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVI_78" id = "tagVI_78" href =
"#noteVI_78">78</a> and an intentional inconsequence of narration,
giving occasion to conversation regarding the author’s control of his
work, is the sudden passing over of the six years which Tobias spent in
Selmann’s house.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_79" id = "tagVI_79" href
= "#noteVI_79">79</a></p>

<p>In connection with Wezel’s occupation with Sterne and Sterne products
in Germany, it is interesting to consider his poem: “Die unvermuthete
Nachbarschaft. Ein Gespräch,”
<span class = "pagenum">149</span>
<a name = "page149" id = "page149"> </a>
which was the second in a volume of three poems entitled “Epistel an die
deutschen Dichter,” the name of the first poem, and published in Leipzig
in 1775. This slight work is written for the most part in couplets and
covers twenty-three pages. Wezel represents Doktor Young, the author of
the gloomy “Night Thoughts” and “Der gute Lacher,&mdash;Lorenz Sterne”
as occupying positions side by side in his book-case. This proximity
gives rise to a conversation between the two antipodal British authors:
Sterne says:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Wir brauchen beide vielen Raum,</p>
<p>Your Reverence viel zum Händeringen,</p>
<p>Und meine Wenigkeit, zum Pfeifen, Tanzen, Singen.”</p>
</div>

<p>and later,</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>. . . “Und will von Herzen gern der Thor der Thoren seyn;</p>
<p>Jüngst that ich ernst: gleich hielt die</p>
<p>Narrheit mich beym Rocke.</p>
<p>Wo, rief sie, willst du hin,&mdash;Du! weisst du unsern Bund.</p>
<p>Ist das der Dank? Du lachtest dich gesund.”</p>
</div>

<p>To Sterne’s further enunciation of this joyous theory of life, Young
naturally replies in characteristic terms, emphasizing life’s
evanescence and joy’s certain blight. But Sterne, though acknowledging
the transitoriness of life’s pleasures, denies Young’s deductions.
Yorick’s conception of death is quite in contrast to Young’s picture and
one must admit that it has no justification in Sterne’s writings. On the
contrary, Yorick’s life was one long flight from the grim enemy. The
idea of death cherished by Asmus in his “Freund Hein,” the welcome
guest, seems rather the conception which Wezel thrusts on Sterne. Death
comes to Yorick in full dress, a&nbsp;youth, a&nbsp;Mercury:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Er thuts, er kommt zu mir, ‘Komm, guter Lorenz, flieh!’</p>
<p>So ruft er auf mich zu. ‘Dein Haus fängt an zu wanken,</p>
<p>Die Mauern spalten sich; Gewölb und Balken schwanken,</p>
<p>Was nuzt dir so ein Haus? . . .’”</p>
</div>

<p>so he takes the wreathèd cup, drinks joyfully, and follows death,
embracing him.</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Das ist mein Tod, ich sehe keinen Knochen,</p>
<p>Womit du ihn, gleich einem Zahnarzt, schmückst,</p>
<p>Geschieht es heute noch, geschieht’s in wenig Wochen,</p>
<span class = "pagenum">150</span>
<a name = "page150" id = "page150"> </a>
<p>Dass du, Gevatter Tod, nur meine Hände drückst?</p>
<p>Ganz nach Bequemlichkeit! du bist mir zwar willkommen.”</p>
</div>

<p>The latter part of the poem contains a rather extended laudation of
the part played by sympathetic feeling in the conduct of life.</p>

<p>That there would be those in Germany as in England, who saw in
Sterne’s works only a mine of vulgar suggestion, a&nbsp;relation
sometimes delicate and clever, sometimes bald and ugly, of the
indelicate and sensual, is a foregone conclusion. Undoubtedly some found
in the general approbation which was accorded Sterne’s books a sanction
for forcing upon the public the products of their own diseased
imaginations.</p>

<p>This pernicious influence of the English master is exemplified by
Wegener’s “Raritäten, ein hinterlassenes Werk des Küsters von
Rummelsberg.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_80" id = "tagVI_80" href =
"#noteVI_80">80</a> The first volume is dedicated to “Sebaldus
Nothanker,” and the long document claims for the author unusual
distinction, in thus foregoing the possibility of reward or favor, since
he dedicates his book to a fictitious personage. The idea of the book is
to present “merry observations” for every day in the year. With the end
of the fourth volume the author has reached March 17, and, according to
the <i>Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek</i>, the sixth volume includes May
22. The present writer was unable to examine the last volume to discover
whether the year was rounded out in this way.</p>

<p>The author claims to write “neither for surly Catos nor for those
fond of vulgar jests and smutty books,” but for those who will laugh. At
the close of his preface he confesses the source of his inspiration: “In
order to inspire myself with something of the spirit of a Sterne,
I&nbsp;made a decoction out of his writings and drank the same eagerly;
indeed I have burned the finest passages to powder, and then partaken of
it with warm English ale, but”&mdash;he had the insight and courtesy to
add&mdash;“it helped me just a little as it aids a lame man, if he steps
in the footprints of one who can walk nimbly.” The very nature of this
author’s dependence on Sterne excludes
<span class = "pagenum">151</span>
<a name = "page151" id = "page151"> </a>
here any extended analysis of the connection. The style is abrupt, full
of affected gaiety and raillery, conversational and journalistic. The
stories, observations and reflections, in prose and verse, represent one
and all the ribaldry of Sterne at its lowest ebb, as illustrated, for
example, by the story of the abbess of Andouillets, but without the
charm and grace with which that tale begins. The author copies Sterne in
the tone of his lucubrations; the material is drawn from other sources.
In the first volume, at any rate, his only direct indebtedness to Sterne
is the introduction of the Shandean theory of noses in the article for
January 11. The pages also, sometimes strewn with stars and dashes,
present a somewhat Sternesque appearance.</p>

<p>These volumes are reviewed in the <i>Allgemeine deutsche
Bibliothek</i><a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_81" id = "tagVI_81" href =
"#noteVI_81">81</a> with full appreciation of their pernicious
influence, and with open acknowledgment that their success demonstrates
a pervision of taste in the fatherland. The author of the “Litterarische
Reise durch Deutschland”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_82" id =
"tagVI_82" href = "#noteVI_82">82</a> advises his sister, to whom his
letters are directed, to put her handkerchief before her mouth at the
very mention of Wegener, and fears that the very name has befouled his
pen. A&nbsp;similar condemnation is meted out in Wieland’s
<i>Merkur</i>.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_83" id = "tagVI_83" href =
"#noteVI_83">83</a></p>

<p>A similar commentary on contemporary taste is obtained from a
somewhat similar collection of stories, “Der Geist der Romane im letzten
Viertel des 18ten Jahrhunderts,” Breslau and Hirschberg, 1788, in which
the author (S.&nbsp;G. Preisser?) claims to follow the spirit of the
period and gives six stories of revolting sensuality, with a thin
whitewash of teary sentimentalism.</p>

<p>The pursuit of references to Yorick and direct appeals to his
writings in the German literary world of the century succeeding the era
of his great popularity would be a monstrous and fruitless task. Such
references in books, letters and periodicals
<span class = "pagenum">152</span>
<a name = "page152" id = "page152"> </a>
multiply beyond possibility of systematic study. One might take the
works<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_84" id = "tagVI_84" href =
"#noteVI_84">84</a> of Friedrich Matthison as a case in point. He visits
the grave of Musäus, even as Tristram Shandy sought for the
resting-place of the two lovers in Lyons (III, p.&nbsp;312); as he
travels in Italy, he remarks that a certain visit would have afforded
Yorick’s “Empfindsamkeit” the finest material for an Ash-Wednesday
sermon (IV, p.&nbsp;67). Sterne’s expressions are cited: “Erdwasserball”
for the earth (V, p.&nbsp;57), “Wo keine Pflanze, die da nichts zu
suchen hatte, eine bleibende Stäte fand” (V, p.&nbsp;302); two
farmsteads in the Tyrol are designated as “Nach dem Ideal Yoricks” (VI,
pp. 24&ndash;25). He refers to the story of the abbess of Andouillets
(VI, 64); he narrates (VIII, pp. 203&ndash;4) an anecdote of Sterne
which has just been printed in the <i>Adress-Comptoir-Nachrichten</i>
(1769, p.&nbsp;151); he visits Prof. Levade in Lausanne, who bore a
striking resemblance to Sterne (V, p.&nbsp;279), and refers to Yorick in
other minor regards (VII, 158; VIII, pp. 51, 77, and Briefe II, 76). Yet
in spite of this evident infatuation, Matthison’s account of his own
travels cannot be classed as an imitation of Yorick, but is purely
objective, descriptive, without search for humor or pathos, with no
introduction of personalities save friends and celebrities. Heinse
alluded to Sterne frequently in his letters to Gleim
(1770&ndash;1771),<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_85" id = "tagVI_85"
href = "#noteVI_85">85</a> but after August 23, 1771, Sterne vanished
from his fund of allusion, though the correspondence lasts until 1802,
a&nbsp;fact of significance in dating the German enthusiasm for Sterne
and the German knowledge of Shandy from the publication of the
Sentimental Journey, and likewise an indication of the insecurity of
Yorick’s personal hold.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous allusions to Sterne, illustrating the magnitude and
duration of his popularity, may not be without interest: Kästner
“Vermischte Schriften,” II, p.&nbsp;134 (Steckenpferd); Lenz “Gesammelte
Werke,” Berlin, 1828, Vol. III, p.&nbsp;312; letter from the Duchess
Amalie, August 2, 1779, in “Briefe an und von Merck,” Darmstadt, 1838;

I, pp. 136, 239; in Hamann’s letters, “Leben und Schriften,” edited by

Familiengespräch über die Physiognomik” in <i>Deutsches Museum</i>, II,
pp. 781&ndash;809, where the French barber who proposes to dip Yorick’s
wig in the sea is taken as a type of exaggeration. And a similar
reference is found in Wieland’s <i>Merkur</i>, 1799, I, p.&nbsp;15:
Yorick’s Sensorium is again cited, <i>Merkur</i>, 1791, II, p.&nbsp;95.
Other references in the <i>Merkur</i> are: 1774, III, p.&nbsp;52; 1791,
I, p.&nbsp;418; 1800, I, p.&nbsp;14; 1804, I, pp. 19&ndash;21;
<i>Deutsches Museum</i>, IV, pp. 66, 462; <i>Neuer Gelehrter
Mercurius</i>, Altona, 1773, August 19, in review of Goethe’s “Götz;”
<i>Almanach der deutschen Musen</i>, 1771, p.&nbsp;93. And thus the
references scatter themselves down the decades. “Das Wörtlein Und,” by
F.&nbsp;A. Krummacher (Duisberg und Essen, 1811), bore a motto taken
from the Koran, and contained the story of Uncle Toby and the fly with a
personal application, and Yorick’s division of travelers is copied
bodily and applied to critics. Friedrich Hebbel, probably in 1828, gave
his Newfoundland dog the name of Yorick-Sterne-Monarch.<a class = "tag"
name = "tagVI_86" id = "tagVI_86" href = "#noteVI_86">86</a> Yorick is
familiarly mentioned in Wilhelm Raabe’s “Chronik der Sperlingsgasse”
(1857), and in Ernst von Wolzogen’s “Der Dornenweg,” two characters
address one another in Yorick similes. Indeed, in the summer of 1902,
a&nbsp;Berlin newspaper was publishing “Eine Empfindsame Reise in einem
Automobile.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_87" id = "tagVI_87" href =

<p>Musäus is named as an imitator of Sterne by Koberstein,
<span class = "pagenum">154</span>
<a name = "page154" id = "page154"> </a>
and Erich Schmidt implies in his “Richardson, Rousseau und Goethe,” that
he followed Sterne in his “Grandison der Zweite,” which could hardly be
possible, for “Grandison der Zweite” was first published in 1760, and
was probably written during 1759, that is, before Sterne had published
Tristram Shandy. Adolph von Knigge is also mentioned by Koberstein as a
follower of Sterne, and Baker includes Knigge’s “Reise nach
Braunschweig” and “Briefe auf einer Reise aus Lothringen” in his list.
Their connection with Sterne cannot be designated as other than remote;
the former is a merry vagabond story, reminding one much more of the
tavern and way-faring adventures in Fielding and Smollett, and
suggesting Sterne only in the constant conversation with the reader
about the progress of the book and the mechanism of its construction.
One example of the hobby-horse idea in this narration may perhaps be
traced to Sterne. The “Briefe auf einer Reise aus Lothringen” has even
less connection; it shares only in the increase of interest in personal
accounts of travel. Knigge’s novels, “Peter Claus” and “Der Roman meines
Lebens,” are decidedly not imitations of Sterne; a&nbsp;clue to the
character of the former may be obtained from the fact that it was
translated into English as “The German Gil Blas.” “Der Roman meines
Lebens” is a typical eighteenth century love-story written in letters,
with numerous characters, various intrigues and unexpected adventures;
indeed, a&nbsp;part of the plot, involving the abduction of one of the
characters, reminds one of “Clarissa Harlowe.” Sterne is, however,
incidentally mentioned in both books, is quoted in “Peter Claus”
(Chapter VI, Vol. II), and Walter Shandy’s theory of Christian names is
cited in “Der Roman meines Lebens.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_88" id

<p>Moritz August von Thümmel in his famous “Reise in die mittäglichen
Provinzen von Frankreich” adopted Sterne’s general idea of sentimental
journeying, shorn largely of the capriciousness and whimsicality which
marked Sterne’s pilgrimage. He followed Sterne also in driving the
sensuous to the borderland of the sensual.</p>

<p>Hippel’s novels, “Lebensläufe nach aufsteigender Linie” and “Kreuz
und Querzüge des Ritters A. bis Z.” were purely Shandean products in
which a humor unmistakably imitated from Sterne struggles rather
unsuccessfully with pedagogical seriousness. Jean Paul was undoubtedly
indebted to Sterne for a part of his literary equipment, and his works
afford proof both of his occupation with Sterne’s writings and its
effect upon his own. A&nbsp;study of Hippel’s “Lebensläufe” in
connection with both Sterne and Jean Paul was suggested but a few years
after Hippel’s death by a reviewer in the <i>Neue Bibliothek der schönen
Wissenschaften</i><a class = "tag" name = "tagVI_91" id = "tagVI_91"
href = "#noteVI_91">91</a> as a fruitful topic for investigation.

Jacobi remarked, in his preface to the “Winterreise” in the edition of
1807, that this section, “Der Taubenschlag” is not to be reckoned as
bearing the trace of the then condemned “Empfindeley,” for many authors,
ancient and modern, have taken up the cause of animals against man; yet
Sterne is probably the source of Jacobi’s expression of his feeling.</p>

Some minor points may be noted. Longo implies (page&nbsp;2) that it was
Bode’s translation of the original Sentimental Journey which was
re-issued in four volumes, Hamburg and Bremen, 1769, whereas the edition
was practically identical with the previous one, and the two added
volumes were those of Stevenson’s continuation. Longo calls Sterne’s
Eliza “Elisha” (p.&nbsp;28) and Tristram’s father becomes Sir Walter
Shandy (p.&nbsp;37), an unwarranted exaltation of the retired
merchant.</p>

CHAPTER VII</a><br>
&nbsp;<br>
OPPOSITION TO STERNE AND HIS TYPE<br>
OF SENTIMENTALISM</h3>


<p>Sterne’s influence in Germany lived its own life, and gradually and
imperceptibly died out of letters, as an actuating principle. Yet its
dominion was not achieved without some measure of opposition. The
sweeping condemnation which the soberer critics heaped upon the
incapacities of his imitators has been exemplified in the accounts
already given of Schummel, Bock and others. It would be interesting to
follow a little more closely this current of antagonism. The tone of
protest was largely directed, the edge of satire was chiefly whetted,
against the misunderstanding adaptation of Yorick’s ways of thinking and
writing, and only here and there were voices raised to detract in any
way from the genius of Sterne. He never suffered in Germany such an
eclipse of fame as was his fate in England. He was to the end of the
chapter a recognized prophet, an uplifter and leader. The far-seeing,
clear-minded critics, as Lessing, Goethe and Herder, expressed <ins
class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘themsleves’">themselves</ins>
quite unequivocally in this regard, and there was later no withdrawal of
former appreciation. Indeed, Goethe’s significant words already quoted
came from the last years of his life, when the new century had learned
to smile almost incredulously at the relation of a bygone folly.</p>

<p>In the very heyday of Sterne’s popularity, 1772, a&nbsp;critic of
Wieland’s “Diogenes” in the <i>Auserlesene Bibliothek der neuesten
deutschen Litteratur</i><a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_1" id =
"tagVII_1" href = "#noteVII_1">1</a> bewails Wieland’s imitation of
Yorick, whom the critic deems a far inferior writer, “Sterne, whose
works will disappear, while Wieland’s masterpieces are still the
pleasure of latest posterity<ins class = "correction" title = ". missing">.”</ins>
This review of “Diogenes” is, perhaps, rather more an exaggerated
<span class = "pagenum">157</span>
<a name = "page157" id = "page157"> </a>
compliment to Wieland than a studied blow at Sterne, and this thought is
recognized by the reviewer in the <i>Frankfurter Gelehrte
Anzeigen</i>,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_2" id = "tagVII_2" href =
"#noteVII_2">2</a> who designates the compliment as “dubious” and
“insulting,” especially in view of Wieland’s own personal esteem for
Sterne. Yet these words, even as a relative depreciation of Sterne
during the period of his most universal popularity, are not
insignificant. Heinrich Leopold Wagner, a&nbsp;tutor at Saarbrücken, in
1770, records that one member of a reading club which he had founded
“regarded his taste as insulted because I sent him “Yorick’s Empfindsame
Reise<ins class = "correction" title = "mismatched quotation marks unchanged">.”</ins><a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_3" id = "tagVII_3"
href = "#noteVII_3">3</a> But Wagner regarded this instance as a proof
of Saarbrücken ignorance, stupidity and lack of taste; hence the
incident is but a wavering testimony when one seeks to determine the
amount and nature of opposition to Yorick.</p>

<p>We find another derogatory fling at Sterne himself and a regret at
the extent of his influence in an anonymous book entitled “Betrachtungen
über die englischen Dichter,”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_4" id =
"tagVII_4" href = "#noteVII_4">4</a> published at the end of the great
Yorick decade. The author compares Sterne most unfavorably with Addison:
“If the humor of the <i>Spectator</i> and <i>Tatler</i> be set off
against the digressive whimsicality of Sterne,” he says, “it is, as if
one of the Graces stood beside a Bacchante. And yet the pampered taste
of the present day takes more pleasure in a Yorick than in an Addison.”
But a reviewer in the <i>Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek</i><a class =
"tag" name = "tagVII_5" id = "tagVII_5" href = "#noteVII_5">5</a>
discounts this author’s criticisms of men of established fame, such as
Shakespeare, Swift, Yorick, and suggests youth, or brief acquaintance
with English literature, as occasion for his inadequate judgments.
Indeed, Yorick disciples were quick to resent any shadow cast upon his
name. Thus the remark in a letter printed in the <i>Deutsches Museum</i>
that Asmus was the German Yorick “only a better moral character,” called
forth a long article in the same periodical for September, 1779, by
<span class = "pagenum">158</span>
<a name = "page158" id = "page158"> </a>
L.&nbsp;H. N.,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_6" id = "tagVII_6" href =
"#noteVII_6">6</a> vigorously defending Sterne as a man and a writer.
The greatness of his human heart and the breadth and depth of his
sympathies are given as the unanswerable proofs of his moral worth. This
defense is vehemently seconded in the same magazine by Joseph von
Retzer.</p>

<p>The one great opponent of the whole sentimental tendency, whose
censure of Sterne’s disciples involved also a denunciation of the master
himself, was the Göttingen professor, Georg Christopher Lichtenberg<ins
class = "correction" title = "superfluous ”">.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVII_7" id = "tagVII_7" href = "#noteVII_7">7</a></ins> In his inner
nature Lichtenberg had much in common with Sterne and Sterne’s imitators
in Germany, with the whole ecstatic, eccentric movement of the time.
Julian Schmidt<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_8" id = "tagVII_8" href =
"#noteVII_8">8</a> says: “So much is sure, at any rate, that the
greatest adversary of the new literature was of one flesh and blood with
it.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_9" id = "tagVII_9" href =
"#noteVII_9">9</a> But his period of residence in England shortly after
Sterne’s death and his association then and afterwards with Englishmen
of eminence render his attitude toward Sterne in large measure an
English one, and make an idealization either of the man or of his work
impossible for him.</p>

<p>The contradiction between the greatness of heart evinced in Sterne’s
novels and the narrow selfishness of the author himself is repeatedly
noted by Lichtenberg. His knowledge of Sterne’s character was derived
from acquaintance with many of Yorick’s intimate friends in London. In
“Beobachtungen über den Menschen,” he says: “I&nbsp;can’t help smiling
when the good souls who read Sterne with tears of rapture in their eyes
fancy that he is mirroring himself in his book. Sterne’s simplicity, his
warm heart, over-flowing with feeling, his soul, sympathizing with
everything good and noble, and all the other
<span class = "pagenum">159</span>
<a name = "page159" id = "page159"> </a>
expressions, whatever they may be; and the sigh ‘Alas, poor Yorick,’
which expresses everything at once&mdash;have become proverbial among us
Germans.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yorick was a crawling parasite,
a&nbsp;flatterer of the great, an unendurable burr on the clothing of
those upon whom he had determined to sponge!”<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVII_10" id = "tagVII_10" href = "#noteVII_10">10</a></p>

<p>In “Timorus” he calls Sterne “ein scandalum Ecclesiae”;<a class =
"tag" name = "tagVII_11" id = "tagVII_11" href = "#noteVII_11">11</a> he
doubts the reality of Sterne’s nobler emotions and condemns him as a
clever juggler with words, who by artful manipulation of certain devices
aroused in us sympathy, and he snatches away the mask of loving, hearty
sympathy and discloses the grinning mountebank. With keen insight into
Sterne’s mind and method, he lays down a law by which, he says, it is
always possible to discover whether the author of a touching passage has
really been moved himself, or has merely with astute knowledge of the
human heart drawn our tears by a sly choice of touching features.<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVII_12" id = "tagVII_12" href =
"#noteVII_12">12</a></p>

<p>Akin to this is the following passage in which the author is
unquestionably thinking of Sterne, although he does not mention him:
“A&nbsp;heart ever full of kindly feeling is the greatest gift which
Heaven can bestow; on the other hand, the itching to keep scribbling
about it, and to fancy oneself great in this scribbling is one of the
greatest punishments which can be inflicted upon one who writes.”<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVII_13" id = "tagVII_13" href =
"#noteVII_13">13</a> He exposes the heartlessness of Sterne’s pretended
sympathy: “A&nbsp;three groschen piece is ever better than a tear,”<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVII_14" id = "tagVII_14" href =
"#noteVII_14">14</a> and “sympathy is a poor kind of alms-giving,”<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVII_15" id = "tagVII_15" href =
"#noteVII_15">15</a> are obviously thoughts suggested by Yorick’s
sentimentalism.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_16" id = "tagVII_16" href
= "#noteVII_16">16</a></p>

<p>The folly of the “Lorenzodosen” is several times mentioned
<span class = "pagenum">160</span>
<a name = "page160" id = "page160"> </a>
with open or covert ridicule<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_17" id =
"tagVII_17" href = "#noteVII_17">17</a> and the imitators of Sterne are
repeatedly told the fruitlessness of their endeavor and the absurdity of
their accomplishment.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_18" id =
"tagVII_18" href = "#noteVII_18">18</a> His “Vorschlag zu einem Orbis
Pictus für deutsche dramatische Schriftsteller, Romanendichter und
Schauspieler”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_19" id = "tagVII_19" href =
"#noteVII_19">19</a> is a satire on the lack of originality among those
who boasted of it, and sought to win attention through pure
eccentricities.</p>

<p>The Fragments<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_20" id = "tagVII_20"
href = "#noteVII_20">20</a> are concerned, as the editors say, with an
evil of the literature in those days, the period of the Sentimentalists
and the “Kraftgenies.” Among the seven fragments may be noted: “Lorenzo
Eschenheimers empfindsame Reise nach Laputa,” a&nbsp;clever satirical
sketch in the manner of Swift, bitterly castigating that of which the
English people claim to be the discoverers (sentimental journeying) and
the Germans think themselves the improvers. In “Bittschrift der
Wahnsinnigen” and “Parakletor” the unwholesome literary tendencies of
the age are further satirized. His brief essay, “Ueber die Vornamen,”<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVII_21" id = "tagVII_21" href =
"#noteVII_21">21</a> is confessedly suggested by Sterne and the sketch
“Dass du auf dem Blockberg wärst,”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_22" id
= "tagVII_22" href = "#noteVII_22">22</a> with its mention of the green
book entitled “Echte deutsche Flüche und Verwünschungen für alle
Stände,” is manifestly to be connected in its genesis with Sterne’s
famous collection of oaths.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_23" id =
"tagVII_23" href = "#noteVII_23">23</a> Lichtenberg’s comparison of
Sterne and Fielding is familiar and significant.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVII_24" id = "tagVII_24" href = "#noteVII_24">24</a> “Aus

Tagebuchblätter, Briefe,” edited by Albert
Leitzmann,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_25" id = "tagVII_25" href =
"#noteVII_25">25</a> contains additional mention of Sterne.</p>

<p>The name of Helfreich Peter Sturz may well be coupled with that of
Lichtenberg, as an opponent of the Sterne cult and
<span class = "pagenum">161</span>
<a name = "page161" id = "page161"> </a>
its German distortions, for his information and point of view were
likewise drawn direct from English sources. Sturz accompanied King
Christian VII of Denmark on his journey to France and England, which
lasted from May 6, 1768, to January 14, 1769<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVII_26" id = "tagVII_26" href = "#noteVII_26">26</a>; hence his stay
in England falls in a time but a few months after Sterne’s death (March
18, 1768), when the ungrateful metropolis was yet redolent of the late
lion’s wit and humor. Sturz was an accomplished linguist and a complete
master of English, hence found it easy to associate with Englishmen of
distinction whom he was privileged to meet through the favor of his
royal patron. He became acquainted with Garrick, who was one of Sterne’s
intimate friends, and from him Sturz learned much of Yorick, especially
that more wholesome revulsion of feeling against Sterne’s obscenities
and looseness of speech, which set in on English soil as soon as the
potent personality of the author himself had ceased to compel silence
and blind opinion. England began to wonder at its own infatuation, and,
gaining perspective, to view the writings of Sterne in a more rational
light. Into the first spread of this reaction Sturz was introduced, and
the estimate of Sterne which he carried away with him was undoubtedly
colored by it. In his second letter written to the <i>Deutsches
Museum</i> and dated August 24, 1768, but strangely not printed till
April, 1777,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_27" id = "tagVII_27" href =
"#noteVII_27">27</a> he quotes Garrick with reference to Sterne,
a&nbsp;notable word of personal censure, coming in the Germany of that
decade, when Yorick’s admirers were most vehement in their claims.
Garrick called him “a&nbsp;lewd companion, who was more loose in his
intercourse than in his writings and generally drove all ladies away by
his obscenities.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_28" id = "tagVII_28"
href = "#noteVII_28">28</a> Sturz adds that all his acquaintances
asserted that Sterne’s moral character went through a process of
disintegration in London.</p>

<p>In the <i>Deutsches Museum</i> for July, 1776, Sturz printed a poem
entitled “Die Mode,” in which he treats of the slavery of
<span class = "pagenum">162</span>
<a name = "page162" id = "page162"> </a>
fashion and in several stanzas deprecates the influence of Yorick.<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVII_29" id = "tagVII_29" href =
"#noteVII_29">29</a></p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Und so schwingt sich, zum Genie erklärt,</p>

</div>

<p>A passage at the end of the appendix to the twelfth Reisebrief is
further indication of his opposition to and his contempt for the frenzy
of German sentimentalism.</p>

<p>The poems of Goeckingk contain allusions<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVII_30" id = "tagVII_30" href = "#noteVII_30">30</a> to Sterne, to
be sure partly indistinctive and insignificant, which, however, tend in
the main to a ridicule of the Yorick cult and place their author
ultimately among the satirical opponents of sentimentalism. In the
“Epistel an Goldhagen in Petershage,” 1771, he writes:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Doch geb ich wohl zu überlegen,</p>
<p>Was für den Weisen besser sey:</p>
<p>Die Welt wie Yorick mit zu nehmen?</p>
<p>Nach Königen, wie Diogen,</p>
<p>Sich keinen Fuss breit zu bequemen,”&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>a query which suggests the hesitant point of view relative to the
advantage of Yorick’s excess of universal sympathy. In “Will auch ’n
Genie werden” the poet steps out more unmistakably as an adversary of
the movement and as a skeptical observer of the exercise of Yorick-like
sympathy.</p>

<p>This poem is a rather successful bit of ridicule cast on the
over-sentimental who sought to follow Yorick’s foot-prints.</p>

<p>The other allusions to Sterne<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_31" id =
"tagVII_31" href = "#noteVII_31">31</a> are concerned with his
hobby-horse idea, for this seems to gain the poet’s approbation and to
have no share in his censure.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">164</span>
<a name = "page164" id = "page164"> </a>
<p>The dangers of overwrought sentimentality, of heedless surrender to
the emotions and reveling in their exercise,&mdash;perils to whose
magnitude Sterne so largely contributed&mdash;were grasped by saner
minds, and energetic protest was entered against such degradation of
mind and futile expenditure of feeling.</p>

<p>Joachim Heinrich Campe, the pedagogical theorist, published in 1779<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVII_32" id = "tagVII_32" href =
"#noteVII_32">32</a> a&nbsp;brochure, “Ueber Empfindsamkeit und
Empfindelei in pädagogischer Hinsicht,” in which he deprecates the
tendency of “Empfindsamkeit” to degenerate into “Empfindelei,” and
explains at some length the deleterious effects of an unbridled
“Empfindsamkeit” and an unrestrained outpouring of sympathetic emotions
which finds no actual expression, no relief in deeds. The substance of
this warning essay is repeated, often word for word, but considerably
amplified with new material, and rendered more convincing by increased
breadth of outlook and positiveness of assertion, the fruit of six years
of observation and reflection, as part of a treatise, entitled, “Von der
nöthigen Sorge für die Erhaltung des Gleichgewichts unter den
menschlichen Kräften: Besondere Warnung vor dem Modefehler die
Empfindsamkeit zu überspannen.” It is in the third volume of the
“Allgemeine Revision des gesammten Schul- und Erziehungswesens.”<a class
= "tag" name = "tagVII_33" id = "tagVII_33" href = "#noteVII_33">33</a>
The differentiation between “Empfindsamkeit” and “Empfindelei” is again
and more accessibly repeated in Campe’s later work, “Ueber die Reinigung
und Bereicherung der deutschen Sprache.”<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVII_34" id = "tagVII_34" href = "#noteVII_34">34</a> In the second
form of this essay (1785) Campe speaks of the sentimental fever as an
epidemic by no means entirely cured.</p>

<p>His analysis of “Empfindsamkeit” is briefly as follows:
“Empfindsamkeit ist die Empfänglichkeit zu Empfindnissen, in denen etwas
Sittliches d.&nbsp;i. Freude oder Schmerz über etwas sittlich Gutes oder
sittlich Böses, ist;” yet in common use the term is applied only to a
certain high degree of such susceptibility. This sensitiveness is either
in harmony or discord with the other powers of the body, especially with
the reason:
<span class = "pagenum">165</span>
<a name = "page165" id = "page165"> </a>
if equilibrium is maintained, this sensitiveness is a fair, worthy,
beneficent capacity (Fähigkeit); if exalted over other forces, it
becomes to the individual and to society the most destructive and
baneful gift which refinement and culture may bestow. Campe proposes to
limit the use of the word “Empfindsamkeit” to the justly proportioned
manifestation of this susceptibility; the irrational, exaggerated
development he would designate “überspannte Empfindsamkeit.”
“Empfindelei,” he says, “ist Empfindsamkeit, die sich auf eine
kleinliche alberne, vernunftlose und lächerliche Weise, also da äussert,
wo sie nicht hingehörte.” Campe goes yet further in his distinctions and
invents the monstrous word, “Empfindsamlichkeit” for the sentimentality
which is superficial, affected, sham (geheuchelte). Campe’s newly coined
word was never accepted, and in spite of his own efforts and those of
others to honor the word “Empfindsamkeit” and restrict it to the
commendable exercise of human sympathy, the opposite process was
victorious and “Empfindsamkeit,” maligned and scorned, came to mean
almost exclusively, unless distinctly modified, both what Campe
designates as “überspannte Empfindsamkeit” and “Empfindelei,” and also
the absurd hypocrisy of the emotions which he seeks to cover with his
new word. Campe’s farther consideration contains a synopsis of method
for distinguishing “Empfindsamkeit” from “Empfindelei:” in the first
place through the manner of their incitement,&mdash;the former is
natural, the latter is fantastic, working without sense of the natural
properties of things. In this connection he instances as examples,
Yorick’s feeling of shame after his heartless and wilful treatment of
Father Lorenzo, and, in contrast with this, the shallowness of Sterne’s
imitators who whimpered over the death of a violet, and stretched out
their arms and threw kisses to the moon and stars. In the second place
they are distinguished in the manner of their expression:
“Empfindsamkeit” is “secret, unpretentious, laconic and serious;” the
latter attracts attention, is theatrical, voluble, whining, vain.
Thirdly, they are known by their fruits, in the one case by deeds, in
the other by shallow pretension. In the latter part
<span class = "pagenum">166</span>
<a name = "page166" id = "page166"> </a>
of his volume, Campe treats the problem of preventing the perverted form
of sensibility by educative endeavor.</p>

<p>The word “Empfindsamkeit” was afterwards used sometimes simply as an
equivalent of “Empfindung,” or sensation, without implication of the
manner of sensing: for example one finds in the <i>Morgenblatt</i><a
class = "tag" name = "tagVII_35" id = "tagVII_35" href =
"#noteVII_35">35</a> a&nbsp;poem named “<ins class = "correction" title
= "text reads ‘Enpfindsamkeiten’">Empfindsamkeiten</ins> am Rheinfalle
vom Felsen der Galerie abgeschrieben.” In the poem various travelers are
made to express their thoughts in view of the waterfall. A&nbsp;poet
<ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘croes’">cries</ins>, “Ye
gods, what a hell of waters;” a&nbsp;tradesman, “away with the rock;”
a&nbsp;Briton complains of the “confounded noise,” and so on. It is
plain that the word suffered a generalization of meaning.</p>

<p>A poetical expression of Campe’s main message is found in a book
called “Winterzeitvertreib eines königlichen preussischen Offiziers.”<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVII_36" id = "tagVII_36" href =
"#noteVII_36">36</a> A&nbsp;poem entitled “Das empfindsame Herz”
(p.&nbsp;210) has the following lines:</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Freund, ein empfindsames Herz ist nicht für diese Welt,</p>
<p>Von Schelmen wird’s verlacht, von Thoren wirds geprellt,</p>
<p>Doch üb’ im Stillen das, was seine Stimme spricht.</p>
<p>Dein Lohn ist dir gewiss, nur hier auf Erden nicht.”</p>
</div>

<p>In a similar vein of protest is the letter of G.&nbsp;Hartmann<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVII_37" id = "tagVII_37" href =
"#noteVII_37">37</a> to Denis, dated Tübingen, February 10, 1773, in
which the writer condemns the affected sentimentalism of Jacobi and
others as damaging to morals. “O&nbsp;best teacher,” he pleads with
Denis, “continue to represent these performances as unworthy.”</p>

<p>Möser in his “Patriotische Phantasien”<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVII_38" id = "tagVII_38" href = "#noteVII_38">38</a> represents
himself as replying to a maid-in-waiting who writes in distress about
her young mistress, because the latter is suffering from “epidemic”
sentimentalism, and is absurdly unreasonable in her practical incapacity
and her surrender to her feelings. Möser’s sound advice is the
substitution of genuine emotion. The whole section is entitled “Für die
Empfindsamen.”</p>

<p>Knigge, in his “Umgang mit Menschen,” plainly has those Germans in
mind who saw in Uncle Toby’s treatment of the
<span class = "pagenum">167</span>
<a name = "page167" id = "page167"> </a>
fly an incentive to unreasonable emphasis upon the relations between man
and the animal world, when, in the chapter on the treatment of animals,
he protests against the silly, childish enthusiasm of those who cannot
see a hen killed, but partake of fowl greedily on the table, or who
passionately open the window for a fly.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVII_39" id = "tagVII_39" href = "#noteVII_39">39</a> A&nbsp;work was
also translated from the French of Mistelet, which dealt with the
problem of “Empfindsamkeit:” it was entitled “Ueber die Empfindsamkeit
in Rücksicht auf das Drama, die Romane und die Erziehung.”<a class =
"tag" name = "tagVII_40" id = "tagVII_40" href = "#noteVII_40">40</a> An
article condemning exaggerated sentimentality was published in the
<i>Deutsches Museum</i> for February, 1783, under the title “Etwas über
deutsche Empfindsamkeit.”</p>

<p>Goethe’s “Der Triumph der Empfindsamkeit” is a merry satire on the
sentimental movement, but is not to be connected directly with Sterne,
since Goethe is more particularly concerned with the petty imitators of
his own “Werther.” Baumgartner in his Life of Goethe asserts that
Sterne’s Sentimental Journey was one of the books found inside the
ridiculous doll which the love-sick Prince Oronaro took about with him.
This is not a necessary interpretation, for Andrason, when he took up
the first book, exclaimed merely “Empfindsamkeiten,” and, as Strehlke
observes,<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_41" id = "tagVII_41" href =
"#noteVII_41">41</a> it is not necessary here to think of a single work,
because the term was probably used in a general way, referring possibly
to a number of then popular imitations.</p>

<p>The satires on “Empfindsamkeit” began to grow numerous at the end of
the seventies and the beginning of the eighties, so that the
<i>Allgemeine Litteratur-Zeitung</i>, in October, 1785, feels justified
in remarking that such attempts are gradually growing as numerous as the
“Empfindsame Romane” themselves, and wishes, “so may they rot together
in a grave of oblivion.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_42" id =
"tagVII_42" href = "#noteVII_42">42</a>
<span class = "pagenum">168</span>
<a name = "page168" id = "page168"> </a>
Anton Reiser, the hero of Karl Philipp Moritz’s autobiographical novel
(Berlin, 1785&ndash;90), begins a satire on affected sentimentalism,
which was to bring shafts of ridicule to bear on the popular sham, and
to throw appreciative light on the real manifestation of genuine
feeling.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_43" id = "tagVII_43" href =
"#noteVII_43">43</a> A&nbsp;kindred satire was “Die Geschichte eines
Genies,” Leipzig, 1780, two volumes, in which the prevailing fashion of
digression is incidentally satirized.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_44"
id = "tagVII_44" href = "#noteVII_44">44</a></p>

<p>The most extensive satire on the sentimental movement, and most
vehement protest against its excesses is the four volume novel, “Der
Empfindsame,”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_45" id = "tagVII_45" href =
"#noteVII_45">45</a> published anonymously in Erfurt, 1781&ndash;3, but
acknowledged in the introduction to the fourth volume by its author,
Christian Friedrich Timme. He had already published one novel in which
he exemplified in some measure characteristics of the novelists whom he
later sought to condemn and satirize, that is, this first novel, “<ins
class = "correction" title = "inconsistent apostrophe unchanged: compare footnote">Faramond’s</ins>
Familiengeschichte,”<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVII_46" id = "tagVII_46" href = "#noteVII_46">46</a> is digressive
and episodical. “Der Empfindsame” is much too bulky to be really
effective as a satire; the reiteration of satirical jibes, the
repetition of satirical motifs slightly varied, or thinly veiled, recoil
upon the force of the work itself and injure the effect. The maintenance
of a single satire through the thirteen to fourteen hundred pages which
four such volumes contain is a Herculean task which we can associate
only with a genius like Cervantes. Then, too, Timme is an excellent
narrator, and his original purpose is constantly obscured by his own
interest and the reader’s interest in Timme’s own story, in his original
creations, in the variety of his characters. These obtrude upon the
original aim of the book and absorb the action of the story in such a
measure that Timme often for whole chapters and sections seems to forget
entirely the convention of his outsetting.</p>

<p>His attack is threefold, the centers of his opposition being
“Werther,” “Siegwart” and Sterne, as represented by their followers
<span class = "pagenum">169</span>
<a name = "page169" id = "page169"> </a>
and imitators. But the campaign is so simple, and the satirist has been
to such trouble to label with care the direction of his own blows, that
it is not difficult to separate the thrusts intended for each of his
foes.</p>

<p>Timme’s initial purpose is easily illustrated by reference to his
first chapter, where his point of view is compactly put and the
soundness of his critical judgment and the forcefulness of his satirical
bent are unequivocally demonstrated: This chapter, which, as he says,
“may serve instead of preface and introduction,” is really both, for the
narrative really begins only in the second chapter. “Every nation, every
age,” he says, “has its own doll as a plaything for its children, and
sentimentality (Empfindsamkeit) is ours.” Then with lightness and grace,
coupled with unquestionable critical acumen, he traces briefly the
growth of “Empfindsamkeit” in Germany. “Kaum war der liebenswürdige
Sterne auf sein Steckenpferd gestiegen, und hatte es uns vorgeritten; so
versammelten sich wie gewöhnlich in Teutschland alle Jungen an ihn
herum, hingen sich an ihn, oder schnizten sich sein Steckenpferd in der
Geschwindigkeit nach, oder brachen Stecken vom nächsten Zaun oder rissen
aus einem Reissigbündel den ersten besten Prügel, setzten sich darauf
und ritten mit einer solchen Wut hinter ihm drein, dass sie einen
Luftwirbel veranlassten, der alles, was ihm zu nahe kam, wie ein
reissender Strom mit sich fortris, wär es nur unter den Jungen
geblieben, so hätte es noch sein mögen; aber unglücklicherweise fanden
auch Männer Geschmack an dem artigen Spielchen, sprangen vom ihrem Weg
ab und ritten mit Stok und Degen und Amtsperüken unter den Knaben
einher. Freilich erreichte keiner seinen Meister, den sie sehr bald aus
dem Gesicht verloren, und nun die possirlichsten Sprünge von der Welt
machen und doch bildet sich jeder der Affen ein, er reite so schön wie
der Yorick.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_47" id = "tagVII_47" href =
"#noteVII_47">47</a></p>

<p>This lively description of Sterne’s part in this uprising is,
perhaps, the best brief characterization of the phenomenon and is all
the more significant as coming from the pen of a contemporary, and
written only about a decade after the inception of the sentimental
movement as influenced and
<span class = "pagenum">170</span>
<a name = "page170" id = "page170"> </a>
furthered by the translation of the Sentimental Journey. It represents a
remarkable critical insight into contemporaneous literary movements, the
rarest of all critical gifts, but it has been overlooked by
investigators who have sought and borrowed brief words to characterize
the epoch.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_48" id = "tagVII_48" href =
"#noteVII_48">48</a></p>

<p>The contribution of “Werther” and “Siegwart” to the sentimental
frenzy are even as succinctly and graphically designated; the latter
book, published in 1776, is held responsible for a recrudescence of the
phenomenon, because it gave a new direction, a&nbsp;new tone to the
faltering outbursts of Sterne’s followers and indicated a more
comprehensible and hence more efficient, outlet for their
sentimentalism. Now again, “every nook resounded with the whining
sentimentality, with sighs, kisses, forget-me-nots, moonshine, tears and
ecstasies;” those hearts excited by Yorick’s gospel, gropingly
endeavoring to find an outlet for their own emotions which, in their
opinion were characteristic of their arouser and stimulator, found
through “Siegwart” a&nbsp;solution of their problem, a&nbsp;relief for
their emotional excess.</p>

<p>Timme insists that his attack is only on Yorick’s mistaken followers
and not on Sterne himself. He contrasts the man and his imitators at the
outset sharply by comments on a quotation from the novel, “Fragmente zur
Geschichte der Zärtlichkeit”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_49" id =
"tagVII_49" href = "#noteVII_49">49</a> as typifying the outcry of these
petty imitators against the heartlessness of their misunderstanding
critics,&mdash;“Sanfter, dultender Yorick,” he cries, “das war nicht
deine Sprache! Du priesest dich nicht mit einer pharisäischen
Selbstgenügsamkeit und schimpftest nicht auf die, die dir nicht ähnlich
waren, ‘Doch! sprachst Du am Grabe Lorenzos, doch ich bin so weichherzig
wie ein Weib, aber ich bitte die Welt nicht zu lachen, sondern mich zu
bedauern<ins class = "correction" title = "inner ’ missing?">!’</ins>
Ruhe <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘dienem’">deinem</ins>
Staube, sanfter, liebevoller Dulter! und nur
einen Funken deines Geistes deinen Affen.”<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVII_50" id = "tagVII_50" href = "#noteVII_50">50</a> He writes not
for the “gentle, tender
<span class = "pagenum">171</span>
<a name = "page171" id = "page171"> </a>
souls on whom the spirit of Yorick rests,”<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVII_51" id = "tagVII_51" href = "#noteVII_51">51</a> for those whose
feelings are easily aroused and who make quick emotional return, who
love and do the good, the beautiful, the noble; but for those who “bei
dem wonnigen Wehen und Anhauchen der Gottheithaltenden Natur, in
huldigem Liebessinn und himmelsüssem Frohsein dahin schmelzt .&nbsp;.
die ihr vom Sang der Liebe, von Mondschein und Tränen euch nährt,” etc.,
etc.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_52" id = "tagVII_52" href =
"#noteVII_52">52</a> In these few words he discriminates between the man
and his influence, and outlines his intentions to satirize and chastise
the insidious disease which had fastened itself upon the literature of
the time. This passage, with its implied sincerity of appreciation for
the real Yorick, is typical of Timme’s attitude throughout the book, and
his concern lest he should appear at any time to draw the English
novelist into his condemnation leads him to reiterate this statement of
purpose and to insist upon the contrast.</p>

<p>Brükmann, a young theological student, for a time an intimate of the
Kurt home, is evidently intended to represent the soberer, well-balanced
thought of the time in opposition to the feverish sentimental frenzy of
the Kurt household. He makes an exception of Yorick in his condemnation
of the literary favorites, the popular novelists of that day, but he
deplores the effects of misunderstood imitation of Yorick’s work, and
argues his case with vehemence against this sentimental group.<a class =
"tag" name = "tagVII_53" id = "tagVII_53" href = "#noteVII_53">53</a>
Brükmann differentiates too the different kinds of sentimentalism and
their effects in much the same fashion as Campe in his treatise
published two years before.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_54" id =
"tagVII_54" href = "#noteVII_54">54</a> In all this Brükmann may be
regarded as the mouth-piece of the author. The clever daughter of the
gentleman who entertains Pank at his home reads a satirical poem on the
then popular literature, but expressly disclaims any attack on Yorick or
“Siegwart,” and asserts that her bitterness is intended for their
imitators. Lotte, Pank’s sensible and unsentimental, long-suffering
<span class = "pagenum">172</span>
<a name = "page172" id = "page172"> </a>
fiancée, makes further comment on the “apes” of Yorick, “Werther,” and
“Siegwart.”</p>

<p>The unfolding of the story is at the beginning closely suggestive of
Tristram Shandy and is evidently intended to follow the Sterne novel in
a measure as a model. As has already been suggested, Timme’s own
narrative powers balk the continuity of the satire, but aid the interest
and the movement of the story. The movement later is, in large measure,
simple and direct. The hero is first introduced at his christening, and
the discussion of fitting names in the imposing family council is taken
from Walter Shandy’s hobby. The narrative here, in Sterne fashion, is
interrupted by a Shandean digression<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_55"
id = "tagVII_55" href = "#noteVII_55">55</a> concerning the influence of
clergymen’s collars and neck-bands upon the thoughts and minds of their
audiences. Such questions of chance influence of trifles upon the
greater events of life is a constant theme of speculation among the
pragmatics; no petty detail is overlooked in the possibility of its
portentous consequences. Walter Shandy’s hyperbolic philosophy turned
about such a focus, the exaltation of insignificant trifles into
mainsprings of action. Shandy bristles with such discussions.</p>

<p>In Shandy fashion the story doubles on itself after the introduction
and gives minute details of young Kurt’s family and the circumstances
prior to his birth. The later discussion<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVII_56" id = "tagVII_56" href = "#noteVII_56">56</a> in the family
council concerning the necessary qualities in the tutor to be hired for
the young Kurt is distinctly a borrowing from Shandy.<a class = "tag"
name = "tagVII_57" id = "tagVII_57" href = "#noteVII_57">57</a> Timme
imitates Sterne’s method of ridiculing pedantry; the requirements listed
by the Diaconus and the professor are touches of Walter Shandy’s
misapplied, warped, and undigested wisdom. In the nineteenth chapter of
the third volume<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_58" id = "tagVII_58"
href = "#noteVII_58">58</a> we find a Sterne passage associating itself
with Shandy rather more than the Sentimental Journey. It is a playful
thrust at a score of places in Shandy in which the author converses with
the reader about the progress of the book, and allows the mechanism of
book-printing and the
<span class = "pagenum">173</span>
<a name = "page173" id = "page173"> </a>
vagaries of publishers to obtrude themselves upon the relation between
writer and reader. As a reminiscence of similar promises frequent in
Shandy, the author promises in the first chapter of the fourth volume to
write a book with an eccentric title dealing with a list of
absurdities.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_59" id = "tagVII_59" href =
"#noteVII_59">59</a></p>

<p>But by far the greater proportion of the allusions to Sterne
associate themselves with the Sentimental Journey. A&nbsp;former
acquaintance of Frau Kurt, whose favorite reading was Shandy, Wieland’s
“Sympatien” and the Sentimental Journey, serves to satirize the
influence of Yorick’s ass episode; this gentleman wept at the sight of
an ox at work, and never ate meat lest he might incur the guilt of the
murder of these sighing creatures.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_60" id
= "tagVII_60" href = "#noteVII_60">60</a></p>

<p>The most constantly recurring form of satire is that of contradiction
between the sentimental expression of elevated, universal sympathy and
broader humanity and the failure to seize an immediately presented
opportunity to embody desire in deed. Thus Frau Kurt,<a class = "tag"
name = "tagVII_61" id = "tagVII_61" href = "#noteVII_61">61</a> buried
in “Siegwart,” refuses persistently to be disturbed by those in
immediate need of a succoring hand. Pankraz and his mother while on a
drive discover an old man weeping inconsolably over the death of his
dog.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_62" id = "tagVII_62" href =
"#noteVII_62">62</a> The scene of the dead ass at Nampont occurs at once
to Madame Kurt and she compares the sentimental content of these two
experiences in deprivation, finding the palm of sympathy due to the
melancholy dog-bewailer before her, thereby exalting the sentimental
privilege of her own experience as a witness. Quoting Yorick, she cries:
“Shame on the world! If men only loved one another as this man loves his
dog!”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_63" id = "tagVII_63" href =
"#noteVII_63">63</a> At this very moment the reality of her sympathy is
put to the test by the approach of a wretched woman bearing a wretched
child, begging for assistance, but Frau Kurt, steeped in the delight of
her sympathetic emotion, repulses her rudely. Pankraz, on
<span class = "pagenum">174</span>
<a name = "page174" id = "page174"> </a>
going home, takes his Yorick and reads again the chapter containing the
dead-ass episode; he spends much time in determining which event was the
more affecting, and tears flow at the thought of both animals. In the
midst of his vehement curses on “unempfindsame Menschen,” “a&nbsp;curse
upon you, you hard-hearted monsters, who treat God’s creatures
unkindly,” etc., he rebukes the gentle advances of his pet cat Riepel,
rebuffs her for disturbing his “Wonnegefühl,” in such a heartless and
cruel way that, through an accident in his rapt delight at human
sympathy, the ultimate result is the poor creature’s death by his own
fault.</p>

<p>In the second volume<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_64" id =
"tagVII_64" href = "#noteVII_64">64</a> Timme repeats this method of
satire, varying conditions only, yet forcing the matter forward,
ultimately, into the grotesque comic, but again taking his cue from
Yorick’s narrative about the ass at Nampont, acknowledging specifically
his linking of the adventure of Madame Kurt to the episode in the
Sentimental Journey. Frau Kurt’s ardent sympathy is aroused for a goat
drawing a wagon, and driven by a peasant. She endeavors to interpret the
sighs of the beast and finally insists upon the release of the animal,
which she asserts is calling to her for aid. The poor goat’s parting
bleat after its departing owner is construed as a curse on the latter’s
hardheartedness. Frau Kurt embraces and kisses the animal. During the whole scene the
<ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘nieghboring’">neighboring</ins>
village is in flames, houses are
consumed and poor people rendered homeless, but Frau Kurt expresses no
concern, even regarding the catastrophe as a merited affliction, because
of the villagers’ lack of sympathy with their domestic animals. The same
means of satire is again employed in the twelfth chapter of the same
volume.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_65" id = "tagVII_65" href =
"#noteVII_65">65</a> Pankraz, overcome with pain because Lotte, his
betrothed, fails to unite in his sentimental enthusiasm and persists in
common-sense, tries to bury his grief in a wild ride through night and
storm. His horse tramples ruthlessly on a poor old man in the road; the
latter cries for help, but Pank, buried in contemplation of Lotte’s lack
of sensibility, turns a deaf ear to the appeal.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">175</span>
<a name = "page175" id = "page175"> </a>
<p>In the seventeenth chapter of the third volume, a&nbsp;sentimental
journey is proposed, and most of the fourth volume is an account of this
undertaking and the events arising from its complications. Pankraz’s
adventures are largely repetitions of former motifs, and illustrate the
fate indissolubly linked with an imitation of Sterne’s related converse
with the fair sex.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_66" id = "tagVII_66"
href = "#noteVII_66">66</a></p>

<p>The journey runs, after a few adventures, over into an elaborate
practical joke in which Pankraz himself is burlesqued by his
contemporaries. Timme carries his poignancy and keenness of satire over
into bluntness of burlesque blows in a large part of these closing
scenes. Pankraz loses the sympathy of the reader, involuntarily and
irresistibly conceded him, and becomes an inhuman freak of absurdity,
beyond our interest.<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_67" id = "tagVII_67"
href = "#noteVII_67">67</a></p>

<p>Pankraz is brought into disaster by his slavish following of
suggestions aroused through fancied parallels between his own
circumstances and those related of Yorick. He finds a sorrowing woman<a
class = "tag" name = "tagVII_68" id = "tagVII_68" href =
"#noteVII_68">68</a> sitting, like Maria of Moulines, beneath a poplar
tree. Pankraz insists upon carrying out this striking analogy farther,
which the woman, though she betrays no knowledge of the Sentimental
Journey, is not loath to accede to, as it coincides with her own
nefarious purposes. Timme in the following scene strikes a blow at the
abjectly sensual involved in much of the then sentimental, unrecognized
and unrealized.</p>

<p>Pankraz meets a man carrying a cage of monkeys.<a class = "tag" name
= "tagVII_69" id = "tagVII_69" href = "#noteVII_69">69</a> He buys the
poor creatures from their master, even as Frau Kurt had purchased the
goat. The similarity to the Starling narrative in Sterne’s volume fills
Pankraz’s heart with glee. The Starling wanted to get out and so do his
monkeys, and Pankraz’s only questions are: “What did Yorick do?” “What
<span class = "pagenum">176</span>
<a name = "page176" id = "page176"> </a>
would he do?” He resolves to do more than is recorded of Yorick, release
the prisoners at all costs. Yorick’s monolog occurs to him and he
parodies it. The animals greet their release in the thankless way
natural to them,&mdash;a&nbsp;point already enforced in the conduct of
Frau Kurt’s goat.</p>

<p>In the last chapter of the third volume Sterne’s relationship to
“Eliza” is brought into the narrative. Pankraz writes a letter wherein
he declares amid exaggerated expressions of bliss that he has found
“Elisa,” his “Elisa.” This is significant as showing that the name Eliza
needed no further explanation, but, from the popularity of the
Yorick-Eliza letters and the wide-spread admiration of the relation, the
name Eliza was accepted as a type of that peculiar feminine relation
which existed between Sterne and Mrs. Draper, and which appealed to
Sterne’s admirers.</p>

<p>Pankraz’s new Order of the Garter, born of his wild frenzy<a class =
"tag" name = "tagVII_70" id = "tagVII_70" href = "#noteVII_70">70</a> of
devotion over this article of Elisa’s wearing apparel, is an open satire
on Leuchsenring’s and Jacobi’s silly efforts noted elsewhere. The garter
was to bear Elisa’s silhouette and the device “Orden vom Strumpfband der
empfindsamen Liebe.”</p>

<p>The elaborate division of moral preachers<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVII_71" id = "tagVII_71" href = "#noteVII_71">71</a> into classes
may be further mentioned as an adaptation from Sterne, cast in Yorick’s
mock-scientific manner.</p>

<p>A consideration of these instances of allusion and adaptation with a
view to classification, reveals a single line of demarkation obvious and
unaltered. And this line divides the references to Sterne’s sentimental
influence from those to his whimsicality of narration, his vagaries of
thought; that is, it follows inevitably, and represents precisely the
two aspects of Sterne as an individual, and as an innovator in the world
of letters. But that a line of cleavage is further equally discernible
in the treatment of these two aspects is not to be overlooked. On the
one hand is the exaggerated, satirical, burlesque; on the other the
modified, lightened, softened. And these two lines of division coincide
precisely.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">177</span>
<a name = "page177" id = "page177"> </a>
<p>The slight touches of whimsicality, suggesting Sterne, are a part of
Timme’s own narrative, evidently adapted with approval and appreciation;
they are never carried to excess, satirized or burlesqued, but may be
regarded as purposely adopted, as a result of admiration and presumably
as a suggestion to the possible workings of sprightliness and grace on
the heaviness of narrative prose at that time. Timme, as a clear-sighted
contemporary, certainly confined the danger of Sterne’s literary
influence entirely to the sentimental side, and saw no occasion to
censure an importation of Sterne’s whimsies. Pank’s ode on the death of
Riepel, written partly in dashes and partly in exclamation points, is
not a disproof of this assertion. Timme is not satirizing Sterne’s
whimsical use of typographical signs, but rather the Germans who
misunderstood Sterne and tried to read a very peculiar and precious
meaning into these vagaries. The sentimental is, however, always
burlesqued and ridiculed; hence the satire is directed largely against
the Sentimental Journey, and Shandy is followed mainly in those
sections, which, we are compelled to believe, he wrote for his own
pleasure, and in which he was led on by his own interest.</p>

<p>The satire on sentimentalism is purposeful, the imitation and
adaptation of the whimsical and original is half-unconscious, and
bespeaks admiration and commendation.</p>

<p>Timme’s book was sufficiently popular to demand a second edition, but
it never received the critical examination its merits deserved.
Wieland’s <i>Teutscher Merkur</i> and the <i>Bibliothek der schönen
Wissenschaften</i> ignore it completely. The <i>Gothaische Gelehrte
Zeitungen</i> announces the book in its issue of August 2, 1780, but the
book itself is not reviewed in its columns. The <i>Jenaische Zeitungen
von gelehrten Sachen</i> accords it a colorless and unappreciative
review in which Timme is reproached for lack of order in his work
(a&nbsp;censure more applicable to the first volume), and further for
his treatment of German authors then popular.<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVII_72" id = "tagVII_72" href = "#noteVII_72">72</a> The latter
statement stamps the review as unsympathetic with Timme’s
<span class = "pagenum">178</span>
<a name = "page178" id = "page178"> </a>
satirical purpose. In the <i>Erfurtische gelehrte Zeitung</i>,<a class =
"tag" name = "tagVII_73" id = "tagVII_73" href = "#noteVII_73">73</a> in
the very house of its own publication, the novel is treated in a long
review which hesitates between an acknowledged lack of comprehension and
indignant denunciation. The reviewer fears that the author is a
“Pasquillant oder gar ein Indifferentist” and hopes the public will find
no pleasure (Geschmack) in such bitter jesting (Schnaken). He is
incensed at Timme’s contention that the Germans were then degenerate as
compared with their Teutonic forefathers, and Timme’s attack on the
popular writers is emphatically resented. “Aber nun kömmt das Schlimme
erst,” he says, “da führt er aus Schriften unserer grössten Schenies,
aus den Lieblings-büchern der Nazion, aus Werther’s Leiden, dem
Siegwart, den Fragmenten zur Geschichte der Zärtlichkeit, Müller’s
Freuden und Leiden, Klinger’s Schriften u.s.w. zur Bestätigung seiner
Behauptung, solche Stellen mit solcher Bosheit an, dass man in der That
ganz verzweifelt wird, ob sie von einem Schenie oder von einem Affen
geschrieben sind.”</p>

<p>In the number for July 6, 1782, the second and third volumes are
reviewed. Pity is expressed for the poor author, “denn ich fürchte es
wird sich ein solches Geschrey wider ihn erheben, wovon ihm die Ohren
gällen werden.” Timme wrote reviews for this periodical, and the general
tone of this notice renders it not improbable that he roguishly wrote
the review himself or inspired it, as a kind of advertisement for the
novel itself. It is certainly a challenge to the opposing party.</p>

<p>The <i>Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek</i><a class = "tag" name =
"tagVII_74" id = "tagVII_74" href = "#noteVII_74">74</a> alone seems to
grasp the full significance of the satire. “We acknowledge gladly,” says
the reviewer, “that the author has with accuracy noted and defined the
rise, development, ever-increasing contagion and plague-like prevalence
of this moral pestilence; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that the author has penetrated
deep into the knowledge of this disease and its causes.” He wishes for
an engraving of the Sterne hobby-horse cavalcade described in the first
chapter, and begs for a second and third volume, “aus deutscher
Vaterlandsliebe.” Timme is called “Our German Cervantes.”</p>

<p>The second and third volumes are reviewed<a class = "tag" name =
"tagVII_75" id = "tagVII_75" href = "#noteVII_75">75</a> with a brief
word of continued approbation.</p>

<p>A novel not dissimilar in general purpose, but less successful in
accomplishment, is Wezel’s “Wilhelmine Arend, oder die Gefahren der
Empfindsamkeit,” Dessau and Leipzig, 1782, two volumes. The book is more
earnest in its conception. Its author says in the preface that his
desire was to attack “Empfindsamkeit” on its dangerous and not on its
comic side, hence the book avoids in the main the lighthearted and
telling burlesque, the Hudibrastic satire of Timme’s novel. He works
along lines which lead through increasing trouble to a tragic
<i>dénouement</i>.</p>

<p>The preface contains a rather elaborate classification of kinds of
“Empfindsamkeit,” which reminds one of Sterne’s mock-scientific
discrimination. This classification is according to temperament,
education, example, custom, reading, strength or weakness of the
imagination; there is a happy, a&nbsp;sad, a&nbsp;gentle,
a&nbsp;vehement, a&nbsp;dallying, a&nbsp;serious, a&nbsp;melancholy,
sentimentality, the last being the most poetic, the most perilous.</p>

<p>The leading character, Wilhelmine, is, like most characters which are
chosen and built up to exemplify a preconceived theory, quite
unconvincing. In his foreword Wezel analyzes his heroine’s character and
details at some length the motives underlying the choice of attributes
and the building up of her personality. This insight into the author’s
scaffolding, this explanation of the mechanism of his puppet-show, does
not enhance the aesthetic, or the satirical force of the figure. She is
not conceived in flesh and blood, but is made to order.</p>

<p>The story begins in letters,&mdash;a method of story-telling which
was the legacy of Richardson’s popularity&mdash;and this device is again
employed in the second volume (Part VII). Wilhelmine Arend is one of
those whom sentimentalism seized like a maddening pestiferous disease.
We read of her that she melted into tears when her canary bird lost a
feather, that she turned white and trembled when Dr. Braun hacked worms
to pieces in conducting a biological experiment. On one occasion she
refused to drive home, as this would take the horses out
<span class = "pagenum">180</span>
<a name = "page180" id = "page180"> </a>
in the noonday sun and disturb their noonday meal,&mdash;an exorbitant
sympathy with brute creation which owes its popularity to Yorick’s ass.
It is not necessary here to relate the whole story. Wilhelmine’s
excessive sentimentality estranges her from her husband, a&nbsp;weak
brutish man, who has no comprehension of her feelings. He finds a refuge
in the debasing affections of a French opera-singer, Pouilly, and
gradually sinks to the very lowest level of degradation. This all is
accomplished by the interposition and active concern of friends, by
efforts at reunion managed by benevolent intriguers and kindly
advisers.</p>

<p>The advice of Drs. Braun and Irwin is especially significant in its
sane characterization of Wilhelmine’s mental disorders, and the
observations upon “Empfindsamkeit” which are scattered through the book
are trenchant, and often markedly clever. Wilhelmine holds sentimental
converse with three kindred spirits in succession, Webson, Dittmar, and
Geissing. The first reads touching tales aloud to her and they two unite
their tears, a&nbsp;sentimental idea dating from the Maria of Moulines
episode. The part which the physical body, with its demands and desires
unacknowledged and despised, played as the unseen moving power in these
three friendships is clearly and forcefully brought out. Allusion to
Timme’s elucidation of this principle, which, though concealed, underlay
much of the sentimentalism of this epoch, has already been made. Finally
Wilhelmine is persuaded by her friends to leave her husband, and the
scene is shifted to a little Harz village, where she is married to
Webson; but the unreasonableness of her nature develops inordinately,
and she is unable ever to submit to any reasonable human relations, and
the rest of the tale is occupied with her increasing mental aberration,
her retirement to a hermit-like seclusion, and her death.</p>

<p>The book, as has been seen, presents a rather pitiful satire on the
whole sentimental epoch, not treating any special manifestation, but
applicable in large measure equally to those who joined in expressing
the emotional ferment to which Sterne, “Werther” and “Siegwart” gave
impulse, and for which they secured literary recognition. Wezel fails as
a satirist, partly
<span class = "pagenum">181</span>
<a name = "page181" id = "page181"> </a>
because his leading character is not convincing, but largely because his
satirical exaggeration, and distortion of characteristics, which by a
process of selection renders satire efficient, fails to make the
exponent of sentimentalism ludicrous, but renders her pitiful. At the
same time this satirical warping impairs the value of the book as a
serious presentation of a prevailing malady. The book falls between two
stools.</p>

<p>A precursor of “Wilhelmine Arend” from Wezel’s own hand was “Die
unglückliche Schwäche,” which was published in the second volume of his
“Satirische Erzählungen.”<a class = "tag" name = "tagVII_76" id =
"tagVII_76" href = "#noteVII_76">76</a> In this book we have a character
with a heart like the sieve of the Danaids, and to Frau Laclerc is
attributed “an exaggerated softness of heart which was unable to resist
a single impression, and was carried away at any time, wherever the
present impulse bore it.” The plot of the story, with the intrigues of
Graf. Z., the Pouilly of the piece, the separation of husband and wife,
their reunion, the disasters following directly in the train of weakness
of heart in opposing sentimental attacks, are undoubtedly children of
the same purpose as that which brought forth “Wilhelmine Arend.”</p>

<p>Another satirical protest was, as one reads from a contemporary
review, “Die Tausend und eine Masche, oder Yoricks wahres Shicksall, ein
blaues Mährchen von Herrn Stanhope” (1777,&nbsp;8<sup>o</sup>). The book
purports to be the posthumous work of a young Englishman, who, disgusted
with Yorick’s German imitators, grew finally indignant with Yorick
himself. The <i>Almanach der deutschen Musen</i> (1778, pp.
99&ndash;100) finds that the author misjudges Yorick. The book is
written in part if not entirely in verse.</p>

<p>In 1774 a correspondent of Wieland’s <i>Merkur</i> writes, begging
this authoritative periodical to condemn a weekly paper just started in
Prague, entitled “Wochentlich Etwas,” which is said to be written in the
style of Tristram Shandy and the Sentimental Journey,
M&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. R&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and “die Beyträge zur
Geheimen Geschichte des menschlichen Herzens und Verstandes,” and
thereby is a shame to “our dear Bohemia.”</p>

<h4><a name = "errors" id = "errors">
Errors and Inconsistencies</a></h4>

<p>German text is unchanged unless there was an unambiguous error, or
the text could be checked against other sources. Most quoted material
is contemporary with Sterne; spellings such as “bey” and “Theil” are
standard.</p>

<p>Missing letters or punctuation marks are genuinely absent, not merely
invisible. Ellipsis (.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.) is shown as printed, as is any
adjoining punctuation.</p>

<p>The variation between “title page” and “title-page” is unchanged.
Punctuation of “ff” is unchanged; at mid-sentence there is usually no
following period. Hyphenization of phrases such as “a twelve-year old”
is consistent.</p>

<p>The Bibliography is shown in the Table of Contents as “Chapter VIII”,
but was printed without a chapter header.</p>
